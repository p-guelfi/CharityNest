The limited access to quality, affordable education stifles each child's unique potential and hinders the community's ability to thrive. Teachers also face challenges due to inadequate training and support, affecting their morale and ability to and restrict their ability to fully engage with students.Thankfully, our November Project of the Month, TCKN Foundation, is tackling this educational challenge by building a modern, fully-equipped school in the village. The project goes beyond providing scholarships and classroom resources—it also prioritizes attracting and training skilled teachers, which will help the Foundation reach more students and expand its impact.When the Foundation shared their plans for the new school building, they emphasized that these efforts will help them fill the school with necessary resources such as classroom equipment and library materials. “We were so thrilled and delighted to hear the news. This is an uplifting morale-booster and deeply appreciated financial support at a time of need.” Christopher Drake, Co-Founder of TCKN Foundation stated.To learn more about how TCKN Foundation is transforming education in Central Java, check out their most recent report.Thank you for your commitment to a better world!With gratitude, Victoria VranaGlobalGiving CEO","teaser":"Dear Project of the Month Club Member,This November, we’re proud to spotlight an organization that is nurturing curiosity and values-based learning for children in Indonesia—an effort that extends far beyond the classroom and uplifts the entire community","charity_project":"Rainforest Alliance"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" October Project Of The Month ","body":"Dear Project of the Month Club Member,This October we are shining a light on an organization standing with Indigenous communities in Chiapas, where indigenous people face constant threats to their autonomy, culture, and way of life due to corporate interests, militarization, and organized crime. However, this tragic assault on land, culture, and autonomy is not sliding without opposition. As Indigenous communities raise their voices for their land and territory, October Project of the Month winner Frayba works to document violent actions against the Indigenous communities, carry out training sessions to help identify risks and threats against their land; and remind the state of their responsibility to defend the lives of local people and create actions for public advocacy of Indigenous rights.When Fundraising Manager Nora González  learned that Frayba had been selected as the October POMC, she shared that these funds will create communication products that help raise awareness of the displacement problem in Chiapas.“We are grateful for this recognition, because it is the result of the efforts of many people,” Nora said. “We are confident that this will help us reach more people who want to donate and show their solidarity with the people of Chiapas.”We invite you to read more about Frayba's impactful work and ongoing challenges by checking out their most recent project report. Thank you for your commitment to a better world! With gratitude, Victoria VranaGlobalGiving CEO","teaser":"Dear Project of the Month Club Member,This October we are shining a light on an organization standing with Indigenous communities in Chiapas, where indigenous people face constant threats to their autonomy, culture, and way of life due to corporate interests, militarization, and organized crime","charity_project":"Clean Energy Transition"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" September Project of the Month ","body":"It’s the start of a new month—and we’re kicking off September by drawing attention to an urgent appeal from our partner Support Yemeni Society Organization for Development SYS. Their team recently reached out for support after heavy floods in Hodeida, Yemen, that are exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the country.The floods have destroyed homes, farms, and infrastructure—displacing families and causing significant loss to life and property. The Support Yemeni Society’s recent project, “Urgent Appeal for Assistance to Flooding in Yemen” will provide emergency food, water, and medical aid to thousands of displaced families.In non-disaster times, the nonprofit works across sectors from biodiversity to education and food security to help Yemeni people, who are experiencing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. According to the UN estimates, the Yemen Civil War has left nearly 55% of the country’s population, or 18.2 million people, in need of assistance. The conflict has disrupted job markets dramatically, making it very difficult for people to earn a living for themselves and their families. Support Yemeni Society knows that to truly help Yemeni people, solutions need to be holistic. Their community support ranges from implementing water treatment systems to providing nutritious meals to thousands of students in rural Yemen. When Founder and CEO Ahmed Al-Qadhi learned that Support Yemeni Society had been selected as the September POMC, he shared that these funds will go a long way in providing critical aid to flood-affected communities. “The funds will allow us to provide aid to reach thousands of displaced families in the immediate aftermath of the floods. Additionally, it will enable us to repair damaged infrastructure like roads and bridges, restoring access to essential services and helping communities get back on their feet. Over the next year, these resources will be instrumental in supporting longer-term recovery efforts, including rebuilding homes, schools, and hospitals, as well as helping revive livelihoods that were devastated by the disaster. We are confident that this partnership with GlobalGiving will have a profound and lasting impact on the lives of those affected by the flooding in Yemen.”Thanks to your ongoing support of this fund, GlobalGiving was able to send a flexible, rapid grant to the Support Yemen Society so they can continue their necessary and compassionate work.

","body":"Hello everyone! We hope you are well! First of all we want to thank you for supporting our forest restoration. The rainy season has started, there's been a lot of water here, which is great for our forests and the seedlings that are being planted. We have made a video to show you some of this work and to keep you updated. Do you remember that Giving Tuesday is coming up? It's on 3 December. We're counting on your help to continue our reforestation and environmental education work. Happy reading, and have a great week!Iracambi helps restore a 10,000 square metre agroforestry areaThe rains have started and with them a lot of work in the ecological restoration areas of our Forests for Water project. Where there's a tree, there's water! Press play to learn about this work, coordinated by Luiz Gusmão, which covers an area of 10,000 square meters in the community of Graminha, in the municipality of Muriaé, in the Zona da Mata region of southeastern Minas Gerais.After two years of planting native species and many fruit trees, the site is already fulfilling some ecological functions in the restoration process, providing organic matter and attracting wildlife and pollinators. Our team is working with resources from @brazilfound to consolidate this agroforestry. It is worth noting that the fertilizer (manure) used on the trees is purchased from the local community and is a way to help supplement the income of families in the rural area.In 25 years of operation, Iracambi has planted 282,000 native trees and has a total of almost 9,000 hectares of environmental protection, the equivalent of 8,300 soccer fields. It's a lot of love for the forest and for our people. Iracambi is synonymous with preserving the Atlantic Forest, biodiversity and transforming lives.Iracambi takes part in the COP16The founders of our NGO,Binka Le Breton and Robin Le Breton took part inCOP16 Colombia, the UN Biodiversity Conference. With the theme “Peace with Nature”, the event gathered representatives from various sectors - governments, companies, the third sector, activists and civil society - to discuss the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, seeking solutions to the planet's most critical challenges.Binka and Robin took part in debates and had the opportunity to share a little about Iracambi's 25 years of experience in restoring the Atlantic Forest in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais, as well as our environmental education, research and volunteering projects. All the actions developed at Iracambi are at the heart of the fight against climate change and our role as agents of change to guarantee biodiversity and a sustainable future for our biome and the planet.Iracambi takes part in course to boost ecotourism We participated in the Tourism Driver Course that took place in Rosário da Limeira, a city in the Zona da Mata (MG), where Iracambi is located, from October 8 to 11. The initiative was promoted by the Faemg/Senar Minas system through the Muriaé Rural Producers' Union, in partnership with the Rosário da Limeira City Hall.The course was taught by tourism expert Gustavo Toledo, who has worked in Iracambi, and was attended by 10 people, including our volunteer/research coordinator Gabriela Soares, and lasted 32 hours. It was an opportunity for a lot of exchange and learning, as the participants were able to visit partner institutions such as Fazenda Iracambi, Verde Aventuras and Fazenda Monte Alegre, and learn on the spot about topics related to tourism, conservation units and entrepreneurship.\"Part of the course took place in Iracambi, and everyone was able to learn a little more about our projects and the potential of tourism. Together we understood the possibilities of each member of the community and what they can offer,\" says our coordinator, Gabriela.As a result, the students created two new tourist itineraries that could be marketed. We thank everyone for this rich experience and we are sure that this course will bear good fruits for the region.

Happy reading, and have a great week!The richness of fauna through the eyes of a volunteerOn World Animal Day, celebrated on October 4th, we share with you the richness of some of the fauna of our Atlantic Forest biome here in Iracambi through the eyes of volunteer Isabel. Isabel has been with us for just over a month and is capturing beautiful and valuable images of the animals. In this video, she tells us a little about this close contact with the fauna in her daily life. Thank you, Isa, for this beautiful and powerful work! The Atlantic Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse biomes on the planet, with 6,498 catalogued animal species, 2,001 of which are endemic (found only in a specific region). It is also one of the most threatened. Of the 1,253 species on the list of endangered fauna in Brazil, 507 are from the Atlantic Forest (7.8%), of which 328 are endemic. The data comes from the Biodiversity Extinction Risk Assessment System of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).The presence of animals in Iracambi is one of the indicators of the health of the ecosystem, biodiversity, and reflects 25 years of work in forest restoration, environmental conservation, natural resource management, research and education for sustainability. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAs91zVus7z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Cameras trap monitor the presence of animals in the forestLet’s take a look at the forest? On September 22, when Fauna Defense Day is celebrated, we’re sharing with you a little about the Intelligent Forests project, developed here in Iracambi to monitor the health of the forest. In this video, volunteer coordinator Gabriela Soares shows how biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest is monitored using trap cameras.These are camera traps placed at strategic points and used to take a closer look at the fauna, i.e. the presence of animals in the forest. Hit play and see how the cameras work with Gabi! The information on fauna obtained through the camera traps is just one part of an extensive diagnosis of the forest ecosystem, which also includes data on vegetation, soil, water, climate and sounds.This work allows us to quantify and monitor changes, as well as develop scientifically validated, data-based reference conditions for forest restoration.

Then play and check out two videos of this pair of bush dogs (Cerdocyon thous) recorded by the camera trap installed in the forest.The information on fauna provided by the camera traps is just one part of a comprehensive diagnosis of the forest ecosystem, which also includes data on vegetation, soil, water, climate and sounds. The presence of animals is an important indicator of biodiversity. Did you know that? Bush dogs usually travel in pairs and are nocturnal. They measure between 57 cm and 77 cm in length. Their tails vary from 22 cm to 41 cm. They weigh between 4.5 kg and 8.5 kg. Their coat is light gray and they have dark legs and rounded ears. Every tree planted is a step toward a balanced ecosystem and the preservation of the species that call these areas home.https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAWZNSLvlxL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==","teaser":"Hello everyone!

The animal was quickly rescued by the company concessionaire of the BR-116 highway and sent to the CTV Veterinary Clinic in Muriaé (MG) for 22 days of treatment and rehabilitation.Fully recovered after treatment, the canid was transferred to our NGO on August 20, when teams from EcoRioMinas, the clinic and Iracambi accompanied its release into the forest.The animal joins other individuals of its species in our area of the Atlantic Forest, which have already been identified by the surveillance cameras installed in the forest. EcoRioMinas and the National Land Transport Agency (ANTT) emphasize their commitment to the conservation of wildlife and the reduction of accidents involving animals on highways.https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_iqHHjuygG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Two saruá monkeys are photographed near the Iracambi headquartersWe would like to share beautiful photos of a pair of Guigó-mascarado or black-faced saruá monkeys (scientific name: Callicebus nigrifrons).The pictures were taken by our new volunteer Isabel Schoroer, who arrived with Charlotte Brosing. They came from Germany and were greeted with a “welcome” from the animals that were in trees very close to our headquarters here in Iracambi.This species has a black face, hands and feet, and the rest of its body is brownish to orange. In our region we call this monkey Sauá, but it is also known by other names: guigó, japuçá, saá, uaiapuçá, uapuçá, iapuçá, sauá, boca-d’água, zogó, zogue-zogue and calicebo.

In celebration of Arbor Day, September 21, we bring you a series of videos about the Iracambi Nursery, where the “jewels” collected from the forest are stored, weighed, catalogued, germinated, cared for, and then replanted in reforestation projects.The seeds are affectionately called “jewels” because they are precious objects that carry life to perpetuate the native Atlantic Forest species that will be used in our projects, such as Forests for Water.The nursery is full of life and energy. If you’ve ever had the chance to be here, you know what it’s like to feel the magic of the place. Between 2020 and 2023, the Iracambi Nursery will produce 82,400 seedlings of 52 native tree species.This work is essential to perpetuate these species, which are essential for the conservation and biodiversity of the forest. To give you an idea of the importance of this work, it’s worth remembering that Iracambi is part of the Trinational Pact for the Restoration of the Atlantic Forest, made up of some 300 institutions from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.The project, which was named a World Restoration Reference by the United Nations (UN) last December, aims to restore 15 million hectares of the Atlantic Forest by 2050.

While these nets may seem harmless once left behind, they pose a serious and persistent threat to marine life and ecosystems. Ghost nets continue to \"fish\" for marine animals, leading to entanglement and often death. Turtles, dolphins, sharks, and fish have all been found trapped in these nets. For instance, turtles entangled in ghost nets are unable to surface for air, leading to drowning, while other animals may die from starvation or exhaustion trying to free themselves. Coral reefs, too, suffer significant damage as larger, heavier nets can smother or break them apart. The removal of ghost nets is critical for protecting marine ecosystems, but it must be done carefully to avoid harming delicate coral structures. Heavier nets often require larger teams, significant manpower, and hours of effort to safely retrieve them.Once retrieved, ghost nets are brought ashore for safe and responsible disposal with the assistance of local authorities.Reef Check Malaysia's Local Marine Conservation Groups (LMCG) deal with the removal of ghost nets when they receive reports from the local islanders. Recently, our team in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah partnered the Marine Research Foundation, Sabah Parks, Sabah Dive Rangers and Scuba Junkie SEAS to organise a ghost net removal program in Tunku Abdul Rahman Park. The 3-day program involved recce dives on the first day to verify the location and depth of the ghost nets that were reported, and to mark these sites with buoys. Over the next two days, a team of 25 divers worked hard to remove 141.7kg of ghost nets. These nets were entangled over a vast reef area and our team was able to remove it without damaging the reefs. Your continued support has made these crucial conservation efforts possible. Thank you for helping us move closer to our goal of conserving Malaysia’s marine ecosystems.","teaser":"Ghost nets are fishing nets that are discarded or abandoned by fishermen when they become torn or entangled in reefs While these nets may seem harmless once left behind, they pose a serious and persistent threat to marine life and ecosystems7kg of ghost nets","charity_project":"Protecting Pollinators"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Student Excitement Soars in Hands-On Marine Education Programs ","body":"Our colleagues in the Mersing group of Islands, Johor have been making waves with their education and awareness program for one of the local schools. Recently, 105 amazing 16 year-olds students had the opportunity to participate in a marine sample demonstration and the much-anticipated Winner Announcement of their first assignment entitled \"Marine Organism and Awareness Social Media Content.\"We spent some time watching and reviewing the fantastic and creative video content produced by these students, who worked in teams. Each teams’ work was reviewed and judged based on content, clarity and charisma.In our previous session with these students, we exposed them to the fascinating marine ecosystems: from coral reefs to mangroves to seagrass beds. In this session, we did a quick recap of all these ecosystems and all the students had a chance at hands-on experience in a sample demonstration, bringing these vital topics to life.Following these sessions, we then had narrowed down the group to 40 students, through their success in the Marine Organism and Awareness assignment. These students went on a field trip to learn about marine wildlife sanctuaries and mangrove ecosystems. The content of this trip focused on the role of predators in maintaining ecological balance through interactive presentations and exploration activities.Here's what the students were up to:-      Visited a Marine Wildlife Sanctuary: They participated in an interactive reptile show and received insights from Sarang Buaya Pasir Gudang Wildlife Officer, regarding crocodiles.-      Visited a mangrove ecosystem: They has a chance to explore and observe vital mangrove habitats, and we took this time to highlight the ecological importance of mangroves.We were fortunate to have volunteers from our partner organisation and support from the marine wildlife sanctuary, as well as the local town council, all of whom made this whole educational trip a success.

","body":"What a torrid couple of days I have had! Monday night, early Tuesday morning between 3-6am, my office, next to my bedroom was robbed of KTD196 laptop. Fortunately we are all fine. Upon discovering the theft I went to the local police station, reported it, and was escorted back to the house by the police who came and inspected the office for clues. They had used a wire to jimmy the window, then somehow managed to capture the laptop through the burglar bars which was a distance from the window without actually entering the premises, thank God! I have 4 dogs, one of which was sleeping in my bedroom, adjacent to the office, and not one of them barked. After the police left I decided to go to the office in Tzaneen, 500metres in the pouring rain I get a flat tyre. Not to be dismayed, I decided to try and remove the wheel nuts myself, but with these pneumatic drills they now use to tighten the nuts, I couldn’t budget it. So, I ring for help from my insurance company. Reception was very poor, so they couldn’t identify on their system where I was despite me telling them the precise location. I eventually received a sms saying someone from Louis Trichardt would be coming to assist me, two hours away. I try and ring back and convince them that I am just outside of the local town, and I know they have service providers only 20mins away in Tzaneen. Eventually a chap from Mooketsi comes to my rescue about an hour later, and it is pelting down, poor man. Anyway, even he had serious problems trying to get the wheel nuts off the wheel. Finally, with the spare on I head back into town to the local tyre repair centre. I get out of the car and take a seat, get called to view the tyre, and promptly slipped (because of the rain) down 2steps and bruise myself a treat. Eventually I find out not one but two screws had lodged in the tyre, which I had collected at the police station, because I heard a funny sound when escorting the police to my place to inspect the breaking site. Finally, the tyre was repaired and placed back on the car and I receive a call from the police saying the finger print technician was now available, could I come back to the police station and show her the way to my home………………………! This time I did not park where I had previously, I remained on the road and just telephone in to say I was there. Escorting the lady to my place was fine, she did her thing, but there were no prints, the offenders wore gloves. SIGH!!! So I am thinking, I still have my old laptop, which has a mother board issue and is living on borrowed time. I get that out, plug it in and switched it on, and you guessed it, it didn’t start! I decided that I would just give up on the day, and pretend it didn’t exist. So I am saying all of this by way of apologizing for not sending you a report yesterday. My old laptop has been resurrected, I have replaced the power cord which seems to have been at fault. Now I am sitting here typing this letter to you, and my internet has decided to die. We have had so much rain over the last 2days that I am sure that is a huge part of the problem. So when I get reception back I will forward this. I know this is not a report on the projects as such but it is a day in my life. Albeit not a typical day but I hope I brightened your day.

I was a scout for 6 years and I have made so many friends. My most precious experience was when I went to Johannesburg for PLTU Course (Patrol Leader Training Unit), we were trained on leadership skills, how to instruct and first aid. Through the training I discovered my career path, I knew right away that I wanted to work with children. After getting my Social Work degree I started working for Keep The Dream 196, I have been enjoying it because one of my deepest passions is working with children. Through KTD196 I have been given the opportunity to change and amend the National Scouts Programme for children throughout South Africa to make it achievable for children in rural and developing communities.One of my special moments as a Social Worker was when my colleague and I were helping out at one of the school groups under Keep The Dream 196. I was in charge of the scout group (age 11-15) and it was doing well, the children were coming to the meeting and actively participating. During one of our troop meetings, a school teacher came with a young boy, looking very angry and she didn’t know what to do with the boy.When she came to me her immediate words were “please help us with this little thief, I am tired, the school is tired and you are our last resort”. After she said that she didn’t even wait for me to respond, she let go of the child and left. Most of the children in the group started rejecting the boy as well because he was a thief and they didn’t want any of their stuff to go missing. After the 1st meeting, I asked some of the leaders in the group why they didn’t want him in the troop. They explained that the boy was a thief, he steals pens just to throw them away, he lies and he sometimes doesn’t sleep at home.I was very worried that the boy sometimes didn’t sleep at home, I had to get more information on him. I decided to go back to the teacher who brought him and asked her to tell me a bit more about the boy she brought to the troop meeting. The teacher explained that the child was basically staying all alone, his mom had a drinking problem and his grandmother sold alcohol as well. The boy practically takes care of himself, he sometimes steals money from his mom not to use it but just to stress his mother. She never attends any parent meetings or cares about how her child is doing academically. The teacher also explained that his grades have been dropping for a while and his mother doesn’t care at all.The following week the boy tried running away from the troop but I called him and asked him to come and he did, I told the other children that we are not perfect and should support each other. The little boy smiled and he asked if he can part of a patrol. He continued coming, he was very active within the troop and I saw how children were starting to accept him and had stopped calling him a thief. The boy started living a positive life, children who were staying next to him explained that he was always home and had started playing soccer. He was no longer stealing from his mother and would sleep at home. Through Keep The Dream 196 I have gained a lot of experience in community development, project management, training in Gender-Based Violence, and my self-confidence has improved as well.I have also had the privilege of representing KTD196 at the International level in Thailand and Kenya working on Child Protection Policies because of my Social Work Degree. I am now also working with the World Scout Movement on the Safe Scouting Policy. KTD196 has opened up so many doors for me to grow and develop but also to influence and bring hope and change to others. The children see me and they see that they too can reach their dreams!Another privilege I have had through KTD196 is the opportunity to travel across different provinces and also throughout Limpopo, learning about different challenges and different cultures, norms and values. I realised there is no one size fits all approach, that is why I love what I do, I am constantly learning and growing.Interview with NkuluNkululeko ‘Nkulu’ was the first Rover in the Limpopo Scout Region to obtain the BP Award, which is the highest Award in South African Rovering. I spoke to her about the role KTD196 and Scouting have had in her life and how she feels about making Rover history in Limpopo. ‘I come from a small village called Shiluvane in Limpopo.I joined the Scout Movement way back in 2003 as a Cub when my mother Elizabeth introduced to it”, explains Nkulu. “My mother was – and still is – part of the Scouts’ family through the partnership with local NGO ‘Keep The Dream 196’. Even though I was a child, I could see how the programme was impacting my life and so I started being fully involved in 2004. My character was developing gracefully and I realised that I was behaving differently than many other children in my community.It was clear that I was learning a lot of things like leadership skills, self-leadership, communication skills, project management skills, perseverance, and of course pioneering – where I learned more about ropes and knots”, she says with a smile. When Nkulu turned 18yrs she stepped into adult uniform, joined the ‘KDT196’ team and started her own Cub Pack for children aged 7-11yrs, plus spearheaded the growth of Cubbing throughout the Limpopo Scout Region once she graduated from university. However, every journey has its challenges and Nkulu has encountered – and overcome – some along the way. “One of my biggest challenges was time management,” continues Nkulu. “At some point, I had to juggle academics as a university student and Scouting. I’m also a bit of an overachiever and so I tried to perfect everything that I did, even things that were beyond my control.So that was challenging at times. But I was able to overcome these challenges by looking at the bigger picture and what I wanted to achieve. I learnt that I can do anything I put my mind to.” Nkulu remained focused on completing the activities required in order for her to achieve her BP Award.“I was elated when I was handed my BP Award,” she says excitedly. “I felt honoured and appreciated that my hard work and dedication had finally paid off. It also boosted my profile and leadership skills. Rovering is all about service and I am so much passionate about community development and about helping children in rural communities to achieve their dreams with the little resources that they have. Some of the activities that I ran within my community included the colour run, career exhibitions, and a recycling project which was done at one of our schools” she adds.Nkululeko is currently also the Chair of the National Cub programme in South Africa. “In addition to achieving my BP Award as a Rover, I also plan on continuing to work together with my Cub team to achieve all our goals and fulfil all my duties. Moreover, by completing the Personal Bar and Movement Bar within the Rover Programme I have learnt that values acquired in Scouting stay with you and motivate you to do more in life. “All of this was made possible through Louise and my mother Elizabeth and their vision to help orphan and vulnerable children in Limpopo by starting Keep The Dream196, and your sponsor! In South Africa, we have a saying “It takes a village to raise a child!” I hope you are happy with your investment in my life.I am like so many others coming up behind me, I just have the privilege of being the first in our province to be awarded this award, but watch this space, more are coming through thanks to you!” Thank you so much and God Bless you NkuluLinks:","teaser":"I started scouts in 2003, as one of the children who were on the pilot phase and immediately loved it I was a scout for 6 years and I have made so many friends Through the training I discovered my career path, I knew right away that I wanted to work with childrenSo that was challenging at times","charity_project":"Clean Energy Transition"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Water as a Human Right!

It is November and we should have seen the start of the tropical rains but as yet, we have not really seen anything more than light sprinkles instead of the torrential rains. The dams are getting lower, the municipalities in the local areas are unable to provide water to the towns on a regular basis, with most towns in the area actually having their water switched off from 0900 till later in the evenings if it returns.That applies to a large number of the cities in this country, as infrastructure decays due to lack of maintenance over the last 20+years. Water restrictions have become common place, in the small town where I live, water on a daily basis is unavailable except for a few hours, the villages have a worse problem as reliance upon water tankers provided by municipality or entrepreneurs capitalising on the corrode infrastructure profit from a commodity guaranteed under Human Rights.Water and sanitation are Sustainable Development Goals identified by the South African Government to action urgently.Imagine, you have a family of 5, 2 adults and 3 children. You will probably have a drop toilet, which means you won’t need water for flushing however with 3 children, you will need to do hand washing daily. School uniforms on a daily basis, plus play clothes as most children may only have one uniform or perhaps two if very fortunate. Imagine trying to wash blankets, sheets, bed linen, by hand and you have minimal water access. What if you have a sick member of the family who has fever and sweats repeatedly overnight, you may need to do bed linen on a daily basis.Cooking, cleaning floors, washing dishes etc., plus drinking! The average water consumption per day is 230-800Litres per household. Now consider, you have to walk 4kms every day with 5 x 20Litre water containers to go and collect water from the closest tap in the village which is turned on daily or even twice a week plus take your turn in the que to receive this precious commodity.Although South Africa is viewed as a first world nation, it has third world conditions. Many school children spend their precious study time waiting in ques for water, as do mothers to whom this chore invariably falls to.Through your support, our SHG groups are consistently demanding the infrastructure to be fixed. At least now in three communities, boreholes have been repaired and water restored. You are making such a huge difference to the day to day lives of the people we serve.

We hope you are well! First of all we want to thank you for supporting our Young Ecoleaders Programme. Check out the video with our coordinator Daiana Duarte about this important work with the children. Do you remember that Giving Tuesday is coming up? It's on 3 December. We're counting on your help to continue our reforestation and environmental education work. Happy reading, and have a great week!Finding out more about the Young Ecoleaders ProgrammeIn the video, coordinator Daiana Duarte talks about the importance of environmental education. It involves six months of fortnightly theoretical and practical classes with students from the public school system in Rosário da Limeira, a city in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais. The topics are worked on according to the students' own experiences, the course is constructive and respects the children's traditional culture. They are monitored and evaluated throughout the semester. At the end of the semester, a big graduation party is held with the students, teachers and parents, bringing the whole community together.Congratulations to all the coordinators, volunteers and workers who are also key players in making Iracambi a benchmark in the region and in Brazil for environmental education, research and reforestation. The project exists thanks to the donations of people who work together to change lives and regenerate the Atlantic Forest. Iracambi helps restore a 10,000 square metre agroforestry areaThe rains have started and with them a lot of work in the ecological restoration areas of our Forests for Water project. Where there's a tree, there's water! Press play to learn about this work, coordinated by Luiz Gusmão, which covers an area of 10,000 square meters in the community of Graminha, in the municipality of Muriaé, in the Zona da Mata region of southeastern Minas Gerais. After two years of planting native species and many fruit trees, the site is already fulfilling some ecological functions in the restoration process, providing organic matter and attracting wildlife and pollinators.Our team is working with resources from @brazilfound to consolidate this agroforestry. It is worth noting that the fertilizer (manure) used on the trees is purchased from the local community and is a way to help supplement the income of families in the rural area.In 25 years of operation, Iracambi has planted 282,000 native trees and has a total of almost 9,000 hectares of environmental protection, the equivalent of 8,300 soccer fields. It's a lot of love for the forest and for our people.Iracambi is synonymous with preserving the Atlantic Forest, biodiversity and transforming lives.Iracambi takes part in the COP16The founders of our NGO,Binka Le Breton and Robin Le Breton took part inCOP16 Colombia, the UN Biodiversity Conference. With the theme “Peace with Nature”, the event gathered representatives from various sectors - governments, companies, the third sector, activists and civil society - to discuss the conservation of biodiversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, seeking solutions to the planet's most critical challenges.Binka and Robin took part in debates and had the opportunity to share a little about Iracambi's 25 years of experience in restoring the Atlantic Forest in the Zona da Mata region of Minas Gerais, as well as our environmental education, research and volunteering projects. All the actions developed at Iracambi are at the heart of the fight against climate change and our role as agents of change to guarantee biodiversity and a sustainable future for our biome and the planet.Links:","teaser":"Hello everyone!

Happy reading, and have a great week!The richness of fauna through the eyes of a volunteerOn World Animal Day, celebrated on October 4th, we share with you the richness of some of the fauna of our Atlantic Forest biome here in Iracambi through the eyes of volunteer Isabel. Isabel has been with us for just over a month and is capturing beautiful and valuable images of the animals. In this video, she tells us a little about this close contact with the fauna in her daily life. Thank you, Isa, for this beautiful and powerful work! The Atlantic Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse biomes on the planet, with 6,498 catalogued animal species, 2,001 of which are endemic (found only in a specific region). It is also one of the most threatened. Of the 1,253 species on the list of endangered fauna in Brazil, 507 are from the Atlantic Forest (7.8%), of which 328 are endemic. The data comes from the Biodiversity Extinction Risk Assessment System of the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).The presence of animals in Iracambi is one of the indicators of the health of the ecosystem, biodiversity, and reflects 25 years of work in forest restoration, environmental conservation, natural resource management, research and education for sustainability. https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAs91zVus7z/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Cameras trap monitor the presence of animals in the forestLet’s take a look at the forest? On September 22, when Fauna Defense Day is celebrated, we’re sharing with you a little about the Intelligent Forests project, developed here in Iracambi to monitor the health of the forest. In this video, volunteer coordinator Gabriela Soares shows how biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest is monitored using trap cameras.These are camera traps placed at strategic points and used to take a closer look at the fauna, i.e. the presence of animals in the forest. Hit play and see how the cameras work with Gabi! The information on fauna obtained through the camera traps is just one part of an extensive diagnosis of the forest ecosystem, which also includes data on vegetation, soil, water, climate and sounds.This work allows us to quantify and monitor changes, as well as develop scientifically validated, data-based reference conditions for forest restoration. Pretty cool, right?https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAOSvwcuBpu/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==Bush dogs caught on camera in the forestDid you want to see images of the fauna captured by our camera traps?

The presence of animals is an important indicator of biodiversity. Did you know that? Bush dogs usually travel in pairs and are nocturnal. They measure between 57 cm and 77 cm in length. Their tails vary from 22 cm to 41 cm. They weigh between 4.5 kg and 8.5 kg. Their coat is light gray and they have dark legs and rounded ears. Every tree planted is a step toward a balanced ecosystem and the preservation of the species that call these areas home.https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAWZNSLvlxL/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==","teaser":"First of all we want to thank you for supporting our forest restoration Do you remember that Giving Tuesday is coming up?

Happy reading, and have a great week!Discover the magic of our nursery, where Atlantic Forest seedlings are plantedEvery forest begins with a seed. In celebration of Arbor Day, September 21, we bring you a series of videos about the Iracambi Nursery, where the “jewels” collected from the forest are stored, weighed, catalogued, germinated, cared for, and then replanted in reforestation projects.The seeds are affectionately called “jewels” because they are precious objects that carry life to perpetuate the native Atlantic Forest species that will be used in our projects, such as Forests for Water.The nursery is full of life and energy. If you’ve ever had the chance to be here, you know what it’s like to feel the magic of the place. Between 2020 and 2023, the Iracambi Nursery will produce 82,400 seedlings of 52 native tree species.This work is essential to perpetuate these species, which are essential for the conservation and biodiversity of the forest. To give you an idea of the importance of this work, it’s worth remembering that Iracambi is part of the Trinational Pact for the Restoration of the Atlantic Forest, made up of some 300 institutions from Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.The project, which was named a World Restoration Reference by the United Nations (UN) last December, aims to restore 15 million hectares of the Atlantic Forest by 2050.Pretty cool, right?

This activity takes place within a workshop for psychosocial support for children affected by the Al-Haouz earthquake, organized by the High Atlas Foundation for Sustainable Development in cooperation with the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS).In the Al-Haouz province, specifically within the Oukaimeden municipality, several women and children received psychosocial support and empowerment through workshops.While the primary goal of these workshops is to alleviate pain and help participants move forward from the earthquake, but during these four days, we also address a set of needs that concern communities, whether related to Emotions, relationships, work, or other matters, in addition to discussion on related topics.In the workshop with children, we usually implement a set of activities over four days. The ages of the participating children usually range from one year to twelve years or more.The aim of the workshop is to give mothers the opportunity to focus on their workshop with peace of mind, and at the same time many children have been greatly affected by the earthquake, so we seek to provide activities and exercises that will help them overcome the effects of this experience and alleviate their suffering.Unlike adults who may express their pain or find ways to vent it, it is difficult to know what is hidden behind the feelings of a young child.In a meeting with Professor Martha (a specialist in psychological and social health, specializing in women and children affected by psychological trauma) and Professor Paula (a psychoanalyst and psychiatrist as well), we talked about the impact of trauma on children.The two professors discussed a set of exercises that include methods that are applied with children, varying according to their ages, and help them easily express what is inside them or what they feel.Among these exercises is \"Life Maps\" exercise, which is a drawing that children do based on the questions asked by their facilitator.The topic of trauma in children varies according to the type of trauma they are going through or have gone through and were unable to overcome.As we know, it is not always easy to know how a child feels about what is happening to them or about an incident they have been through. Talking about this topic was very helpful for me, and I even tried to apply it in a number of psychosocial support workshops for children affected by the earthquake.In Oukaimeden, during a workshop for 26 children between the ages of one and thirteen, which lasted four days, we engaged in a variety of activities that included entertainment, learning, and awareness-raising.Life Maps involved giving each child a paper and a pen. I asked them to draw in response to specific questions, allowing them ample time to complete their drawings. Afterward, I approached each child individually to understand their explanation of what they had drawn.Through this process, I realized that while a child might seem energetic and cheerful on the outside, their inner pain may not always be visible. However, their drawings can reveal hidden emotions.For instance, an eleven-year-old drew a family with a line separating the mother and daughter from the father, and beneath the picture, they wrote: “Growing up without a father.”We often assume that toys, gifts, or other material things bring happiness and joy to children. However, it’s important to ask them if they are truly okay, in a manner appropriate to their age, and to make an effort to understand them. This is essential at all times, but especially if they have experienced any significant events or trauma.Life Maps is just one exercise, but there are many other activities that have helped me deal with trauma in children, which the two professors discussed during our meeting. It's really important, before you give your child anything, to try to understand them and their feelings.","teaser":"Life Maps is an exercise in which children express what they cannot articulate through drawingIn the Al-Haouz province, specifically within the Oukaimeden municipality, several women and children received psychosocial support and empowerment through workshops","charity_project":"Protecting Indigenous Land Rights"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Sudden change is harmful ","body":"On March 23rd, 2024, in the old city of Marrakesh, the High Atlas Foundation team organized a psychosocial support workshop in partnership with Project Hope for girls from different villages in the Marrakesh-Safi region living at Dar Moustaqbel to complete their secondary and university studies.When we arrived at the workshop venue, we found the girls ready to start the workshop. We introduced the organization and its activities, although the girls were familiar with what the organization does through social media. We then started to get to know each other and, one by one, began to melt the barrier between us.After that, we started talking about that night of the earthquake and where the girls were. A girl in her twenties said, \"We forgot about that night, we shouldn't talk about it again.\"From her words and how she spoke, we realized that this girl had not been able to get over that night even a little bit. After all, if she really got over it and started living with it, then she would talk about it.Moments later, she heard her roommates talking about that night; she felt supported and felt it was necessary to talk about how the night of the earthquake went for her and share her feelings with us, so she started talking, and the first thing she said was: “That night my life changed dramatically, I saw a fantastical and terrifying sight.”The girl was at her parents' house in one of the Al Haouz districts. After finishing dinner with her family in an atmosphere of laughter and fun, she went to the sink to brush her teeth in a place overlooking the balcony of the house, as she saw stones falling from the mountain and a black whirlwind in the sky. This sight frightened the girl and made her freeze in place from the horror of the sight, not understanding what happened. She says: \"Oh God, is this the Day of Judgment, are we going to die suddenly, I'm not ready...\"Her family took her out of the house, screaming and saying they were going to die.The girl remained in a hysterical state of panic and screaming. She didn't stop until her father started reciting some verses from the Quran to calm her down and come to her senses.After that scary day, the girl could no longer sit in the house alone, especially the balcony of the house, which before the earthquake, was an outlet for her and a place where she could relax and do whatever she wanted on that balcony. Now, it has become a scary and terrifying place for her. It's impossible for her to sit there, even by accident. A drastic change in her life.  When the girl talked, she was scared and could hardly express what she had experienced the night of the earthquake.But by the time she finished speaking, she started feeling relieved that she had let it all out and shared what she had experienced with her coworkers and staff. She also got some advice that eased her mind.Our main goal is to listen to our beneficiaries and offer as much advice as possible.The earthquake really changed the lives and thoughts of many people, making them review themselves and everything they do. The earthquake had negative aspects, the death of people, the destruction of houses, fear, sadness, living in tents.But, on the other hand, there are positive aspects, as this event made people reconcile and remove the grief they carry in their hearts towards each other and become one hand, cooperating, helping, and fearing for each other.","teaser":"On March 23rd, 2024, in the old city of Marrakesh, the High Atlas Foundation team organized a psychosocial support workshop in partnership with Project Hope for girls from different villages in the Marrakesh-Safi region living at Dar Moustaqbel to complete their secondary and university studies","charity_project":"Whale Conservation in the Pacific"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" A Day of Harmony ","body":"unaware of the profound and enlightening experiences that awaited us. Our interactions with the village children and Mercer University students unfolded into a symphony of learning, performance, and community building, surpassing all expectations.As someone deeply engrossed in education, particularly in teaching English to non-native speakers, I found myself reflecting on the many ways in which we can bridge cultural and linguistic divides.The day began with a palpable sense of excitement as we prepared to meet the children who eagerly awaited our arrival. Without a clear expectation of what I was getting myself into, I was ready to dive into teaching.However, what I hadn’t anticipated was the absolutely invaluable role that music and performance would play in this educational landscape.Accompanying us was a professor specializing in performance studies and its applications across different cultures. This professor's insights into how performance can transcend linguistic barriers were invaluable as the children opened up as soon as we introduced interactive musical activities.Singing together, we broke down walls of inhibition and built a bridge of understanding. Despite my self-proclaimed lack of musical talent (which I still hold true), I found myself singing along, my voice merging with those of the children and my fellow volunteers.In those moments, I realized the transformative power of music—it was not just about melody or rhythm but about connection and shared joy.Interacting with the High Atlas Foundation office staff was truly another highlight of the day. Despite the significant language barrier—I speak very little Darija—I learned through sheer proximity and necessity.The laughter that ensued from our attempts to communicate was a testament to the universal language of humor.Mispronunciations and misunderstandings turned into moments of shared amusement, and through these interactions, I formed genuine friendships.The staff's warmth and patience taught me that communication goes beyond words; it's about effort and the willingness to understand one another.Meeting the Mercer students was equally enriching. Their passion for their studies and their musical talents were genuinely inspiring. I had the unique opportunity to learn about different instruments and even tried my hand at playing the cello for a brief moment.The Mercer students' willingness to share their knowledge and the joy they derived from their music was infectious, adding another layer of connection to our diverse group.What struck me most about this day was how seamlessly education, performance, and community blended together. Initially, I saw these as distinct aspects, each valuable in its own right. However, as the day progressed, I began to see their interdependence.Teaching English became more effective through music; performance became a tool for education, and community bonds were strengthened through shared experiences.The holistic approach seen with HAF, integrating various facets of development and cultural exchange, proved incredibly effective, and I am positive that these events' future impact is equally profound.Reflecting on the day's events, I am grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a meaningful initiative. The High Atlas Foundation's commitment to empowering Moroccan communities through education, cultural preservation, and sustainable development was evident in every interaction and activity.This experience has enriched my understanding of educational methodologies and highlighted the importance of cultural exchange and community engagement in creating lasting impact.It reaffirmed my belief in the power of collaboration and the beauty of diverse perspectives coming together for a common goal.

Her (very amateur) underwater photography contributes to documenting reef health through iNaturalist.  Leona will also scope out possible contacts in the French Polynesia for C4C to expand community involvement in the UNESCO recognized Reefs of Hope program with guidelines set and supervised by Austin and field trained indigenous people often with marine academic background.Field Notes from Leona:Sadly my camera ran out of batteries underwater before we met the two lovely Fijian girls on Dravuni Island.  I will try to get you some great underwater pictures today from “Split Rock” near Savusavu – the coral and fish there were amazing!  Its funny, we saw a green sea turtle in the coral near the tip of Dravuni Island and once he saw us, he scurried off so quickly, I’m not sure we’ve ever seen a turtle move so fast. Later when talking to Esther and Hope, they mentioned they eat sea turtles, I guess that’s why that poor turtle was so skittish!  ","teaser":"As all grassroots GlobalGiving organizations enter the Thanksgiving Season, Corals for Conservation wishes to pause and not only thank you, but also to take a moment to share the contributions from two of our special members  She is equipped with GPS and cameras","charity_project":"Accelerating Clean Energy Solutions"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Hot July Fundraiser will Save Corals in Ba Fiji ","body":"A successful short window fundraising opportunity hosted by GlobalGiving has super-charged our efforts and we're happy to annouce that Corals for Conservation will have enough to begin work immediately towards saving corals in another key site.","teaser":"A successful short window fundraising opportunity hosted by GlobalGiving has super-charged our efforts and we're happy to annouce that Corals for Conservation will have enough to begin work immediately towards saving corals in another key site","charity_project":"Protecting the Arctic"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" LAUNCHING OF OCEAN CORAL \"OASIS\" BULA MEANS LIFE ","body":"Why Did We Build Bula Reef?In September 2023, after the Caribbean suffered extreme heat and shallow waters as hot as 38.4C, we were warned that this coral bleaching was coming to Fiji.  We were worried about the heat-adapted coral populations that live in very shallow waters would get too hot for their survival.  So, starting last September, over a thousand corals were collected from the hottest reefs and moved to cooler waters to build Bula Nursery.  Sadly, the corals left behind mostly died when the water got above 35C (>95F), but the corals moved to the nursery did not bleach, and they still survive!   Bula means Life, and Bula Rescue Nursery has helped us keep life in the ocean and on our coral reefs!  We hope that these efforts will now be used as an example to other areas of the world which still have hot pocket coral populations. Bula Reef is Part of a Much Bigger, \"Reefs of Hope\" Solution!UNESCO just in February endorsed C4C’s “Reefs of Hope” strategies as an Ocean Decade Action, implemented to help coral reefs adapt to climate change by securing and preventing the loss of heat-adapted corals on coral reefs.  https://oceandecade.org/actions/reefs-of-hope/  Bula reef is the first project of this strategy!   \"Reefs of Hope\" builds on a foundation of local action in the South Pacific and supports the resilience of community-based no-fishing tabu areas in the face of climate change.  Communities sacrificing for the environment are supported with livelihoods development and capacity building in coral-focused work, to enhance their locally managed areas by planting bleaching resistant corals.  Resorts are encouraged to support the program by hiring trained coral reef adaptation technicians to serve as coral gardeners at resorts, as well as to support community resort partnerships for conservation.  Corals for Conservation’s primary partner in the Fiji coral-focused work is Plantation Island Resort, assisted by the Fiji Ministry of Fisheries, and funded by crowd-sourced donations through GlobalGiving, and small grants received from UNEP, and the European Union.  The community-tourism-NGO- Government partnership has been instrumental in making new and innovative advancements to prevent the collapse of coral reefs locally, and C4C has recently expanded the work to Kiribati, Tuvalu, Samoa, PNG, and Vanuatu via local partners in each country.  The work has now been honoured and elevated as the first coral-focused solution for climate change adaptation of coral reefs by the UNESCO endorsement. With the building of Bula Nursery, we are calling on everyone to do their best to become part of the solution!  We believe that if people are the problem, that people are also the solution!  Thank you for bringing our coral rescue effort to the world stage, and for your constant support.  Austin","teaser":"Why Did We Build Bula Reef?In September 2023, after the Caribbean suffered extreme heat and shallow waters as hot as 384C, we were warned that this coral bleaching was coming to Fiji  https://oceandecade  Austin","charity_project":"Marine Ecosystem Restoration"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Mangrove for the survival from Tropical Cyclones in the coast ","body":"Cyclones and tidal surges are common scenario in the coastal area of Bangladesh. Due to the cyclone hit many of the people suffer in the coast. Only mangroves can save the coastal people. One of the most devastating cyclone Remal hit on the coast in the month of May 24. The highest recorded wind speed was 111 km/h and the storm surge, accompanied by extremely heavy rainfall, caused flooding of 5-8 feet in the coastal districts. Over 173,000 houses were damaged, including 40,338 that were completely uninhabitable. About 80,591 hectares of cultivable land were inundated. Additionally, 50,000 fish enclosures, 34,000 ponds, and 4,000 crab farms were severely flooded, disrupting food supply chains, and exacerbating livelihoods and food insecurity. More than 530,000 farmers have been affected by damage to crops worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). (IFRC, 1 Jul 2024)BEDS (Bangladesh Environment and Development Society) is always working for coastal protection by planting mangroves in the river bank side. According to the comparison it was proved that where the forest exist less damage was appeared but where there was empty land a lot of damage was occurred. So, the local community of Sutarkhali, Dacope, Khulna decided to plant mangroves at their empty places for the coastal protection.BEDS and Korea Green Foundation (KGF) arranged a mangrove education program and plantation ceremony at Sutarkhali which is funded by Green Alliance by Hanwha Japan. The inaugural ceremony was organized by the local community. They invited the school teachers of Shital Chandra Higher Secondary School, Local government representative, BEDS and the community people. There the school teachers and BEDS team discussed about the importance of mangroves and about mangrove plantation. BEDS team aware the people and discussed how mangroves play roles in disaster period. The most common problem is now is the riverbank erosion. The local government welcomed the 10 steps Community Based Ecological Mangrove Restoration (CBEMR). After discussion community people arranged a rally and plant mangroves in 2ha of riverbank land. With this supportive initiative community people are preparing seed bed to develop a plot nursery for the mangrove saplings.

In early 2024 the Hero School teachers visited 4 communities that demonstrated a desperate need to improve and expand their school infrastructure.  After extensive consideration, the Hero School teachers settled on working in the small village of Aguas Calientes. Aguas Calientes is located about 10 miles from Comalapa and is part of the Comalapa municipality. The Aguas Calientes middle school teachers explained that they have students waiting to enroll but that there is not enough space.  An additional classroom would allow them to enroll another 20 local students. That settled it and Hero School committed to pooling all available resources to build the classroom. Our first call was to Ecohab.org, specialists in off-grid infrastructure, design, and implementation.  Ecohab invited 15 of their full-time crew and another 11 people signed up for the Green Building Workshop.  When combined with the Hero School builders and volunteers we were a solid crew of 35.    For one month the team worked Monday through Saturday to build this classroom. Throughout the month the Aguas Calientes middle school students jumped into the fray and provided invaluable support around the construction site while simultaneously learning the tricks of the green building trade.  And the vibe around the job site was enthusiastic. Everywhere you looked there were smiles.  Each day we could see the progress and each evening we relived the day's successes.  And yes this classroom is run with solar power! This is the only solar panel in the village!Unlike so many well-intentioned construction projects, we finished what we started in the time allotted.  On the last day the Aguas Calientes teachers and students, the Ecohab builders, the Hero School crew, representatives from the Ministry of Education and all of the international volunteers broke bread to celebrate our united victory.

Here’s one inspiring story of change we’re thrilled to share with you.A Story of RADHA.........!!My name is Radha (Name Changed), and I am 13 years old. I have always loved nature and felt a deep connection with the environment. From a young age, I learned about the importance of taking care of our planet, and it has become a big part of who I am. I believe that everyone has a role in protecting our Earth, and I’m always excited to find ways to help. One of my favorite days of the year is World Environment Day. It’s a day dedicated to raising awareness about environmental issues and encouraging people to take action to protect our planet. This year, something special happened at my school for World Environment Day. Rajasthan Samgrah Kalyan Sansthan (RSKS India) organized a celebration and awareness program, and I was thrilled to be a part of it. The day started with a lot of excitement. RSKS India’s team came to our school with a plan to celebrate World Environment Day in a meaningful way. They organized several activities to help us understand the importance of protecting our environment and to encourage us to take action. I couldn’t wait to get started!One of the most exciting parts of the program was the tree planting activity. I had always wanted to plant trees, and this was a wonderful opportunity to do so. The RSKS team provided us with young saplings and guided us on how to plant them properly. We went outside to a designated area where we carefully planted our trees. As I placed the little tree in the ground and covered its roots with soil, I felt a sense of hope and responsibility. I knew that with proper care, these small trees could grow into something big and beautiful. Before we started planting, the RSKS team explained why trees are so important. They told us how trees help clean the air, provide oxygen, and offer shelter and food for many animals. They also explained that trees play a crucial role in combating climate change. Learning about these benefits made me even more excited to contribute.After planting the trees, we took an oath to protect them and to continue promoting tree plantation. The ceremony was meaningful, and it felt great to make a commitment to care for the environment. We also learned how we can help in other ways, like reducing waste, conserving water, and using eco-friendly products. The day wasn’t just about planting trees. The RSKS team also organized educational sessions and games to teach us more about the environment. We learned fun facts about nature, participated in quizzes, and discussed ways to make our school and community greener. It was inspiring to see so many of my classmates getting involved and showing their support for the environment. At the end of the day, we had a small celebration with snacks, and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. It was amazing to see how much we could achieve in just one day. The experience made me even more passionate about protecting the environment and spreading awareness.Thanking you so much for your kind cooperation and financial support. it is very without your generous donation difficult for us !!At RSKS India, we value your feedback, comments, and suggestions on our programs.

We need individual donors like you to ensure that our anti-poaching patrols can safeguard wild tigers as your donations are critical to ensuring that we provide the best possible protection for an increasing wild tiger and cub population.Conflict is a Major ConcernWhen we compare to 2010 when Tigers4Ever was founded, we are nothing short of amazed and proud. Even though Bandhavgarh’s forest habitat remains unchanged in size, there are now five times as many wild tigers for us to keep safe. Both the human and wild tiger populations continue to grow, which is placing immense pressure on the ecosystem and its inhabitants. With limited tolerance from both wild tigers and humans, conflict is inevitable. Over the past year, our focus has been on several initiatives to mitigate these conflicts and address their consequences.Those who have been following Tigers4Ever’s other projects will know about our major projects to reduce human-wildlife conflict through eco-friendly solutions like solar-powered wildlife waterholes and solar lighting at the forest’s edge, protecting high-risk villages from loss of life, livestock, and crops. Others will also know that we have been rolling out our Forest Safety Education initiative, over the last 15 months. Both of these vital projects aim to reduce accidental encounters and attacks in the forest AND to reduce both kinds of conflict inside and outside the forest. In 2024 we have invested £18000 ($24300) in replacing worn-out uniforms and dilapidated equipment for the brave men and women who risk their lives daily to protect wild tigers. More is still needed but we need to raise more funds before we can do more.Our anti-poaching patrollers work tirelessly in some of the planet’s most extreme and dangerous environments, performing one of the toughest jobs in the world. Did you know that our patrols have covered more than 29705km (18458 miles) whilst protecting wild tigers in 2024 alone?  India is home to three-quarters of the global wild tiger population, with 3,167 wild tigers, including 785 in Madhya Pradesh where our patrollers operate. Bandhavgarh’s wild tiger population has increased fivefold from 37 in 2010 to more than 210 today, a success story made possible by your support!Worryingly, in the last few weeks of the monsoon the number of snare wires and signs of anchored traps are increasing again. The farmers frequently tie wire snares around the boundary of their crops and villages to prevent crop raiding, but these wire snares are indiscriminate and will kill tigers and leopards too. Our patrollers systematically remove the wires and fill the anchor points with sand or soil to prevent hidden tethered snares along the trails where tigers walk. During the monsoon rainfall and for the following weeks when the forest floor is waterlogged, the patrollers need to be extra vigilant against snares as they can be easily concealed and can snare a patroller’s foot too.However, as the wild tiger population grows, so does the risk of tiger-tiger conflict. The aggressive roars of territorial battles can echo up to 8 miles away, prompting our patrollers to approach with caution. A wounded tiger is extremely dangerous, and our patrollers must stay alert to avoid attacks on them too. They search for signs of injury and, if necessary, call for veterinary assistance. Sadly, sometimes it’s too late, and the lifeless body of a once-majestic tiger is found. Despite being a natural death, it’s heartbreaking to see such a magnificent creature lying lifeless. Without restored habitat and more waterholes, sadly tiger-tiger conflict will continue to increase.Increasing tiger numbers inevitably leads to an increase in poaching, in addition to increased tiger-tiger and human-tiger conflict, so we can’t afford to reduce our patrolling now. Wild tigers need more habitat and protection, so we extended our patrolling range a few months ago to include areas where some of the sub-adult tigers from Bandhavgarh have migrated. More wild tigers mean more territorial conflicts and natural deaths, thus expanding and improving forest habitat is crucial, and we are actively working on forest rehabilitation projects and hope to have the green light to start the work soon. We’ve identified a 100 acre area of denuded forest where we hope to clear invasive lantana before planting saplings from 32 native tree species and grasslands to provide food for elephants and the tigers’ prey. In June 2024, Tigers4Ever Trustees planted 12 native tree saplings at Tala Camp as a commitment to Bandhavgarh’s future.Every day, we confront these challenges head-on. In 2023, wild tiger deaths in India reached a 15-year high with 181 reported deaths, which was a 150% increase from 2022. The 2024 death toll has already reached 102, including 13 due to tiger-tiger conflict in Bandhavgarh. It is vital that we continue maximum patrolling to protect wild tigers during the lead up to year-end as so many young cubs would not survive if their mother or father was killed by a poacher’s snare. Meanwhile, our work to enhance the existing wild tiger habitat and to reduce conflict through our wildlife waterholes project continues: https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/water-for-bandhavgarhs-tigers/.Enhancing protection for wild tigers and their habitat ensures that more cubs survive, which in turn means that more protection is needed, and as the number of wild tigers exceeds the carrying capacity of their current habitat, further urgent action is essential. We have already reached a critical impasse in both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict.Thankfully, our patrolling helps to keep unnatural wild tiger deaths at bay in Bandhavgarh, but we cannot let down our guard as poachers are always lurking and seeking opportunities to strike. Your kind donations have ensured that we can fund increased patrolling into November 2024. We’re hoping that our supporters who can help will choose to do so, so that our anti-poaching patrols can continue to keep wild tigers safe throughout the next few months and beyond (https://goto.gg/28767).Instances of human-tiger conflict at the extreme level can lead to dangerous challenging times for our anti-poaching patrollers too, as they are tiger protectors and rural communities often exact revenge on patrollers as they attempt to remove a tiger which has attacked or killed. Our patrols need to always remain vigilant, especially whilst attempting to restore calm. We continue to deliver our forest safety education training to those we encounter in the forest to try to reduce the risk of further deaths-whether those are human or tigers.Our patrols frequently remove wires and snares set to capture wild boar and herbivores which enter the villages to raid the farmers’ crops and livestock fodder. These wires and snares are indiscriminate and have killed tigers and their cubs too. Precious tiger lives can easily be lost when they follow their prey into the villages in search of food and it is why our projects to reduce human-wildlife conflict form a vital cornerstone of our efforts to keep wild tigers safe.We strive to keep both tigers and their prey out of the villages as it reduces the risk of retaliatory poisonings. The heavy rains and thunderstorms of the monsoon season have now been replaced by cooler drier shorter days as the new challenges of winter approach so the warm jackets, uniforms, sturdy boots and powerful flashlights you’ve help us provide are crucial now: https://goto.gg/56553. Our focus will soon turn to raising funds for the remaining 180 of 600 anti-poaching patrollers and chowkidars who desperately need full uniforms and boots as they have none. We supplied 420 uniforms and boots pre-monsoon thanks to your generosity and the kindness of our friends at Typical Tigers NFT, but it will take a mammoth fundraising effort to supply the remaining 180 before the end of this year (£5400/US$7020): https://goto.gg/56553.Human EncroachmentWith the forest replenished by new growth, human encroachment into the forest will increase as livestock owners take their animals to graze. Whist the poorest people will harvest whatever they can to sell. This increases the risk of human-wildlife conflict as more and more encroachers encounter wild tigers, elephants, leopards and snakes as they roam. Our safety education banners and handouts will save lives as these people know how to react to a sudden encounter with a wild animal, but when the safety advice is ignored, there is an issue. It’s not just human lives which are saved by forest safety education but those of the wild tigers too, because people retaliate when a tiger attacks one of their own, and such retaliation can lead to multiple deaths of both humans and tigers, so prevention is the best solution. During patrolling our brave patrollers carry laminated replicas of our safety education banners so they can show those who they encounter in the forest how to react if they meet a wild tiger, leopard, elephant or snake. The patrollers make them aware of the location of the safety information in their villages too. Raising awareness is just one vital role which our anti-poaching patrollers perform in their daily duties. (https://goto.gg/28767).Fundraising to cover our current patrolling costs continues to challenge us so we must be cautious when extending our patrolling range further. The poachers know that the cubs born during the pandemic are old enough to leave their mothers’ protection now and are making their own way in the world, so we are on high alert to curb this risk and have tripled patrolling and extended our range as a result. These vulnerable young tigers will face many challenges in their quest for their own territory, not least sibling rivalry and aggression from their own parents. They will also face battles with other young adult tigers seeking to establish their own territories too and other adult tigers which have already staked their claim. As young tigers migrate further afield, our brave men and women patrollers will risk their lives to keep them safe. It will be a challenge to protect them all!We are proud of our patrollers and their amazing efforts to keep wild tigers safe. During the last 3 years their workload has increased 3-fold and our patrollers have responded with outstanding effort and hard work whilst poaching activity around India has reached a 15-year high. It is a miracle in the circumstances that we continue to keep so many wild tigers safe!What Else are we Doing to HelpThe recent increase in both human-wildlife conflict and Tiger-Tiger conflict around Bandhavgarh is a major concern, as highlighted above. As the wild tiger population continues to grow, the struggle to find sufficient territory to call home will intensify, and conflict incidents will increase in frequency, until more water and habitat can be provided to curtail it. We have spent the last nine months repairing solar pumps at eight of our waterhole sites and providing four more permanent wildlife waterholes in four different areas of Bandhavgarh. We also plan to put another solar-powered wildlife waterhole in the Kithauli core area preferably before the end of 2024. (https://goto.gg/34315).  We have also erected solar-powered street lighting in 20 areas of known human-tiger conflict in the last month as part of a pilot scheme to reduce the risk of tigers entering the villages and killing livestock and people. We are currently monitoring the results closely before rolling out the scheme in 25 other high-risk areas.When conflict incidents are coupled with the increased risk of poaching activities, it means that our patrollers need to always be on high alert. We must ensure that we can maintain a minimum of tripled patrolling now, especially as poaching activity is on the increase. https://goto.gg/28767.Making a DifferenceYour continued support means that we can cover an extra 1800 km (1135 miles) of wild tiger territory per month with our tripled patrols. During patrolling, it is essential to ensure sufficient time to search for snares; traps and signs of poisoners around forest areas where human encroachment is widespread as poachers are more active. We need to maintain our patrols around the periphery of villages where crop raiding and livestock killing is rife. Our increased patrolling helps us to curb human encroachment into wild tigers’ territories and allows us to provide safety advice for those trying to protect their crops and livestock from wandering elephants and tigers respectively.With around 210 wild tigers to keep safe, your help is crucial. In the last month, we’ve received news of 4 more precious tiny cubs which need our help. Your gift, however large or small can make a huge difference as to whether Bandhavgarh’s wild tigers and cubs can survive the unprecedented threats they face:Without our help, we know that more wild tigers will die; and more humans will be mauled or killed due to encroachment or human-tiger conflict. Sadly, with every human life lost comes another threat to the wild tiger’s survival in the form of retaliation; thus, we must protect both if we are to ensure that wild tigers can have a wild future.Please don’t hesitate if you can help, your donation can be the difference between life and death for a wild tiger, as it helps to increase our patrolling when it is most needed. Every tiger and every tiger cub counts. Thank you for making our fight against poachers, the changing climate and human-animal conflict possible.

It has been an incredibly busy period for Tigers4Ever and I’m not sure that I’ll be able to fit everything into this project update report without making it more like a journal! Don’t worry though, there will be two more project reports over the next few weeks so we will be sure to cover everything across the three reports. Sadly, one of our biggest concerns this year has been the increase in both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict which remain at a 15-year high. As a result, the role of our anti-poaching patrols has evolved into one of peacekeeping alongside their existing busy schedule of policing, protecting, teaching and firefighting. Without your amazing support it would be almost impossible to achieve what we have achieved in the last six months. We have successfully completed tripled patrolling for the 9 months since the end of the 2023 monsoon; and with peak poaching season the 2024 monsoon season almost upon us we will quadruple our patrolling to deal with the challenging conditions and increased risks.Conflict is a Major ConcernThe size of Bandhavgarh’s forest habitat isn’t growing but the human and wild tiger populations both are. This puts an enormous pressure on the forest habitat and the animals within. Tolerance is not usually in abundance in either the wild tiger or the human populations and thus conflict is inevitable. In the last year, we have been focussing on several initiatives to both mitigate the risk of conflict and address the consequences of the conflict when it occurs. If you have been following Tigers4Ever for some time, you will know already that we have a major project to reduce human-wildlife conflict via the installation of eco-friendly solutions such as solar powered permanent wildlife waterholes and more recently solar powered lighting at the edge of the forest where it meets high risk villages which have suffered loss of life, loss of livestock and loss of crops. In addition, we launched our Forest Safety Education initiative almost one year ago with the objective to reduce human-wildlife conflict due to accidental encounters and serendipitous attacks. We have also spent a considerable amount of time and money over the last two years replacing uniforms and equipment for the brave men and women who risk their lives daily to keep wild tigers safe.Our anti-poaching patrollers work tirelessly day and night in some of the planet's most extreme and dangerous environments, doing one of the toughest jobs in the world, to protect wild tigers and other wildlife on the front line of conservation. Three quarters of the global wild tiger population is in India - 3167 wild tigers (785 of these are in Madhya Pradesh, where our brave patrollers work). Bandhavgarh’s wild tiger population has quadrupled from 37 in 2010, when Tigers4Ever was founded. A huge success story which would have been impossible without your help! This population continues to grow, and sadly wild tigers are dying because of Tiger-Tiger conflict. Upon hearing the aggressive roars of two wild tigers in territorial conflict (a sound which can echo up to 8 miles away!), patrollers approach with care. A wounded tiger is a very dangerous tiger and could attack and kill an unsuspecting patroller if they failed to stay alert. The patrollers look for signs of injury, blood in the sandy tracks, a lost claw or clumps of fur or skin. Where necessary they will call for the vet and/or animal recue vehicle to attend the scene if needed, but sometimes it is too late…. The victor has fled the scene, and the loser lies lifeless on the ground. The heart-breaking moment when the death of a wild tiger is confirmed, details are noted, and the post-mortem performed prior to cremating the tiger’s remains to prevent poachers and chancers taking body parts for profit. Despite it being the lore of the jungle and a natural death, it still hurts to see a once beautiful and strong wild tiger lying lifeless on the ground.As wild tiger numbers continue to increase, sadly the risk of poaching, tiger-tiger conflict and human-tiger conflict will increase too. Wild tigers need more habitat and more protection, we have recently extended our patrolling range to include an area of forest where we know sub-adult tigers born in Bandhavgarh have migrated. There will be more natural deaths of wild tigers due to territorial conflict because more wild tigers need more wild space, and fights are more frequent. It is hard to curb the lore of the jungle without expanding or improving the forest habitat, which is something we still plan to do. We have visited some tree nurseries recently to assess the availability of saplings for our tree planting/forest rehabilitation project which we hope to launch this year. In the meantime, Tigers4Ever Trustees have purchased 12 saplings which have now been planted at Tala Camp in Bandhavgarh as a commitment to ensuring that trees will thrive in Bandhavgarh even after we are gone. In the coming months we hope to share the progress of these young trees too.Every day we try to address these challenges head on. The number of wild tigers which died in India in 2023 reached a 15 year high (181 reported deaths – 150% of 2022 figure)! Whilst the official death toll for 2024 has reached 68 including 11 deaths due to tiger-tiger conflict in Bandhavgarh! It is vitally important that we continue our maximum level patrolling during the monsoon to keep the remaining wild tigers safe during the peak poaching season! Meanwhile, we are improving the existing wild tiger habitat to try to reduce both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict via our wildlife waterholes project:https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/water-for-bandhavgarhs-tigers/.In our last project update report, we told you about our new initiative to reduce human-wildlife conflict based on a similar project used in the Sundarbans. This involves using solar powered street lighting at the point where the forest meets the village entry point to deter wild tigers from entering the villages at night in search of prey. The early results have been promising so we have installed solar street lighting at a further 10 locations, but we still need to monitor progress over a much longer period before we can claim success.Enhancing protection for wild tigers and their habitat ensures that more cubs survive, which means more protection is needed, and as the number of wild tigers exceeds the carrying capacity of their current habitat, further urgent action is essential. We have already reached a critical impasse in both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict.Peak Poaching SeasonThankfully, our patrolling continues to keep unnatural wild tiger deaths at bay in Bandhavgarh, but we cannot let down our guard as poachers are always lurking and seeking opportunities to strike. Your kind donations and a grant we received from Tiger Awareness in March 2024 has enabled us to fund increased patrolling into June 2024. We now plan to quadruple our patrolling for the monsoon period which is peak poaching season and the season with the most human-wildlife conflict. We hope that our supporters who can afford to do so will continue to help our anti-poaching patrols to keep wild tigers safe throughout the next three months (monsoon season) and beyond (https://goto.gg/28767).The rollout of our safety education programme is almost complete, but our patrollers still encounter lone herders in the forest grazing their cattle and putting their lives at risk! When questioned, they say that they know about the safety advice but grazing their cattle is more important! Our patrollers inform them that people have been killed in the area by wild tigers and that if they too are killed who will support their families, some listen – others don’t! Every human death results in significant unrest in the villages and, with it the risk of retaliatory attacks on tigers by angry villagers! Such situations lead to extreme levels of human-tiger conflict and dangerous challenging times for the anti-poaching patrollers too, as they are tiger protectors and villagers can often exact revenge on them. Our patrols need to remain vigilant always, especially whilst trying to restore calm.Our patrols remove wires and snares set to capture wild boar and herbivores which enter the villages to raid the farmers’ crops and livestock fodder. These wires and snares are indiscriminate and have killed tigers and their cubs in the past. Precious tiger lives can easily be lost when they follow their prey into the villages in search of food which is why our projects to reduce human-wildlife conflict form a vital cornerstone of our efforts to keep wild tigers safe.We fight hard to keep both tigers and their prey out of the villages as it reduces the risk of retaliatory poisonings. The heavy rains of the monsoon season will soon replace the tough patrolling conditions of the hot drought season which can be plagued by forest fires. We continue to equip the 600 anti-poaching patrollers and chowkidars who desperately need new full uniforms and boots as they have none. So far we have supplied uniforms and boots for 420 of these brave patrollers with help from your donations, Grant Funding and our friends at Typical Tigers NFT, but it will take a mammoth fundraising effort to supply the remaining 180 before the end of this monsoon season (£5400/US$7020).  https://goto.gg/56553.Fundraising to cover our current patrolling costs continues to challenge us so we must take this into account before confirming long term plans.

It is a miracle in the circumstances that we continue to keep so many wild tigers safe!Increased AwarenessDuring the monsoon season, human encroachment into the forest increases as black plum and Amla trees bear their fruit making prized pickings for the poorest people to sell. This in turn increases the risk of human-wildlife conflict as more and more villagers encounter wild tigers, elephants, leopards and snakes as they roam. Our safety education banners and handouts will ultimately save lives when people know what to do when they have a sudden encounter with a wild animal. It isn’t just the human lives which will be saved but those of the wild tigers too. This is because villagers will retaliate when a tiger attacks one of their own, such retaliation could lead to multiple deaths of both humans and tigers, so prevention is the best solution.

The patrollers make them aware of the location of the safety information in their villages too. Raising awareness is just one vital role which our anti-poaching patrollers perform in their daily duties.We still want to develop an audio resource for future training which can be delivered in the villages by volunteers as part of a wider awareness and environmental protection programme, however, this is subject to raising sufficient funds.What Else are we Doing to HelpThe recent increase in both human-wildlife conflict and Tiger-Tiger conflict around Bandhavgarh is a major concern, as highlighted above. As the wild tiger population continues to grow, the struggle to find sufficient territory to call home is intensifying, and conflict incidents are becoming weekly events, which is putting more pressure on the need for more water and habitat to curtail the crisis. As previously reported, we prioritised repairs of elephant and environmental damage at six of our waterhole sites in the first quarter of 2024. In the last six weeks our attention has turned to providing more permanent wildlife waterholes with work on our 20th waterhole in the Dhamokhar buffer nearing completion; and work on 3 further waterholes expected to be complete by the beginning of July 2024, bringing the total number of Tigers4Ever waterholes to 24. We still plan to put another solar-powered wildlife waterhole in the Kithauli core area although this will now be after the monsoon season or in early 2025 as we have prioritised 3 new sites where the lack of water has led to recent human-wildlife conflict, (https://goto.gg/34315).  We have also erected solar-powered street lighting in 20 areas of known human-tiger conflict in the last 3 months as part of a pilot scheme to reduce the risk of tigers entering the villages and killing livestock and people. We are monitoring the results closely before rolling out the scheme in other high-risk areas.When conflict incidents are coupled with the increased risk of poaching activities, it means that our patrollers need to be on high alert at all times. We must ensure that we can maintain a minimum of quadrupled patrolling especially throughout the next three months when we know that the poachers will be very active. https://goto.gg/28767.Making a DifferenceThanks to your continued support, we can cover an extra 2700 km (1678 miles) of wild tiger territory per month with our quadrupled patrols. The patrollers need sufficient time to search for snares; traps and signs of poisoners around forest areas where human encroachment is widespread, especially during the monsoon season when poachers are more active. We also need to maintain our patrols around the periphery of villages where crop raiding and livestock killing is rife. Our increased patrolling helps us to curb human encroachment into wild tigers’ territories and allows us to provide safety advice for those trying to protect their crops and livestock from wandering elephants and tigers respectively.Small charities like Tigers4Ever rely greatly on individual donors like you to be able to deliver our essential services to keep wild tigers safe. Thus, your donations are critical to ensuring that we can provide the best possible protection for the increasing wild tiger and cub population.We are currently protecting more wild tigers and cubs than ever before, and your help is crucial in ensuring that we can keep them safe. We know that there are at least 22 precious small cubs which are totally dependent on their mothers for survival so we will be working even harder to keep the mothers safe. Your gift, however large or small can make a huge difference as to whether Bandhavgarh’s wild tigers and cubs can survive the unprecedented threats they face:Without our help, we know that more wild tigers will die; and more humans will be mauled or killed due to encroachment or human-tiger conflict.

As a small charity, we rely heavily on individual donors like you to deliver the essential services which help us to keep wild tigers safe. As a result, your donations are essential to ensuring that we can provide the best protection we can for the growing wild tiger and cub population.Conflict and Deaths are still on the IncreaseAs previously reported, the results of the 2022 Tiger Census were announced in July 2023, and confirmed that India has three-quarters of the world’s global wild tiger population - 3167 wild tigers (785 of which are in Madhya Pradesh). The wild tiger population in Bandhavgarh has quadrupled from 37 in 2010, when our efforts to give them a wild future commenced. A massive success story which we couldn’t have achieved without your help!With these increases, the risk of poaching, tiger-tiger conflict and human-tiger conflict also increases, as wild tigers need more habitat and more protection. This is our new daily challenge and it has been keeping us very busy for the last year and possibly even last two years. The number of wild tigers dying across the whole of India has been at a new 15 year record level in 2023 (181 reported deaths – 150% of 2022 figure)! The death toll for 2024 already stands at 25 with 4 of the deaths due to tiger-tiger conflict in Bandhavgarh! It is taking everything we have to keep wild tigers safe now! As wild tiger numbers grow, there will always be an increase in the number of natural deaths because more wild tigers need more wild space, and fights for territory become more frequent. This is the lore of the jungle and is something which is hard to curb without forest expansion or forest improvement schemes. We continue to work behind the scenes on forest rehabilitation initiatives, but launching such a large project during a cost-of-living crisis brings with it a significant fundraising challenge too. We are currently researching funding options which will make it possible to start this long term habitat restoration and expansion project. Meanwhile, we are working to improve the existing wild tiger habitat to try to reduce both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict through our waterholes project:https://www.globalgiving.org/projects/water-for-bandhavgarhs-tigers/and a new initiative to reduce human-wildlife conflict which has been trialled in the Sundarbans to reduce tigers entering the villages at night in search of prey. Enhancing protection for the wild tigers and their habitat ensures that more cubs are surviving, which means more protection is needed and importantly the number of wild tigers will exceed the carrying capacity of their current habitat. At this point we have reached a critical impasse in both human-wildlife and tiger-tiger conflict.Thankfully, our patrolling has kept unnatural wild tiger deaths at bay in Bandhavgarh, but we cannot afford to let down our guard as poachers are always lurking and seeking opportunities to strike. Your kind donations and a grant we received from Tiger Awareness has enabled us to fund increased patrolling into April 2024. We’re hoping that our supporters who receive GlobalGiving gift cards will also choose to help our anti-poaching patrols to keep wild tigers safe throughout the upcoming drought season and beyond (https://goto.gg/28767).Human deaths are on the increase too, since the start of 2024 two more people have been killed by wild tigers, in addition to the six killed in the latter part of 2023! Despite the rollout of our safety education programme, our patrollers are still encountering lone herders in the forest grazing their cattle and putting their lives at risk! When questioned, they say that they are aware of the safety advice but grazing their cattle is more important! Our patrollers tell them that people have recently been killed in the area by wild tigers and that if they too are killed who will support their families, some listen – others don’t! Every human  death results in significant unrest in the villages and, with it the risk of retaliatory attacks on tigers by angry villagers increases a thousand-fold! At the end of 2023, 3 different tigers were implicated in human killings, and 2 young male tigers were captured by the forest department and transferred to Van Vivar Zoo in Bhopal where they will spend the rest of their lives! No place for wild tigers to live out their lives no matter how large or good the zoo is!. The third tiger implicated was a tigress who has 4 sub-adult cubs, one of which was one of the tigers transferred to Van Vivar zoo! The tigress has also been captured and incarcerated by the forest department leaving her remaining young sub-adult cubs to fend for themselves. The fate of her cubs remains uncertain as they will need to hunt for themselves and stay as a group for protection for around nine more months until they are old enough to defend themselves and their territory. Whilst their father is around, they have some protection from intruding males looking for a mate, but male tigers have several mates and do not give their cubs the same protection as their mothers would. This is human-tiger conflict at the extreme level. It is also a challenging and dangerous time for anti-poaching patrollers, as they are the tiger protectors and villagers are known to exact revenge on patrollers too. Our patrols must remain extra vigilant always whilst trying to restore a semblance of calm. We continue to roll out our forest safety education training and banners in the nearby villages to try to reduce the risk of further deaths of whether humans or tigers.Our patrols continue to report the removal of wires and snares set to capture wild boar and herbivores which enter the villages to raid the farmers’ crops and livestock fodder. These wires and snares are indiscriminate and have killed tigers and their cubs in the past. Precious tiger lives can easily be lost when they follow their prey into the villages in search of food. This is why our projects to reduce human-wildlife conflict form a fundamental cornerstone of our efforts to keep wild tigers safe.Where possible, we fight hard to keep both tigers and their prey out of the villages as it reduces the risk of retaliatory poisonings too. As the tough winter patrolling conditions are now behind us for another year, we are grateful for your donations which meant that 805 patrollers now havewarm winter jacketsfor thetackling the coldest patrolling conditions: https://goto.gg/56553. Grant funding from the Marjorie Coote Animal Charity Trust and from the Thin Green Line meant that only 200 patrollers are without a warm winter jacket now, something which we hope to address later in 2024. Our focus now turns to the 600 anti-poaching patrollers and chowdikars who desperately need full uniforms and boots as they have none. We recently ordered and supplied the first 55 of these uniforms and boots but it will take a mammoth fundraising effort to supply the rest this year (£16285/US$21350).  https://goto.gg/56553.Mahua and Tendu PickingWe don’t currently have either the funds or patrolling resources to expand the area which we patrol, as our team is already stretched to the limit with the increased patrolling workload. It is a dilemma; we don’t want to lose more migrating tigers but we also don’t want to reduce the protection in the areas we currently patrol. Just to add another 78 miles (125km) to our patrolling area would cost another £123 (US$160) per day, which right now is impossible. (https://goto.gg/28767). Soon the Mahua and Tendu leaf picking season will be upon us and human-wildlife conflict will undoubtedly increase alongside the risk of forest fires! Forest fires can quickly get out of control and our patrollers play a vital role in not only fighting the fires to prevent their spread but in the early identification of burning leaf litter, etc., which can easily lead to uncontrolled fires. For the next four months our patrollers will see their workload increase alongside the challenges they face.Fundraising to cover our current patrolling costs continues to be a challenge so we don’t anticipate being able to extend our patrolling further before the monsoon. The poachers already know that most of the cubs born during the pandemic are old enough to leave their mothers’ protection and make their own way in the world, so we are already on high alert to address this risk and will endeavour to return to quadrupled patrolling for the monsoon peak poaching season in 2024 too. The vulnerable young tigers will face many challenges in their quest for a territory to call their own, not least sibling rivalry and aggression from their own parents. They will also face battles with other young adult tigers seeking to establish their own territories and other adult tigers which have already staked their claim. As young tigers migrate further afield, our brave men and women patrollers will risk their lives to keep them safe. It will be a challenge to protect them all! We are proud of our patrollers and their amazing efforts to keep wild tigers safe. During the last 3 years their workload has increased 3-fold and our patrollers have responded with outstanding efforts and hard work whilst poaching activity around India has reached a 15 year high. It is a miracle in such circumstances that we have been able to keep so many wild tigers safe!Increased AwarenessA lack of volunteers in Bandhavgarh meant that we asked our patrollers to help us to deliver forest safety education training and banners to the villages alongside conducting their patrolling. Their dedication to duty is second to none, they took the extra workload on with a smile. So far, they have delivered forest safety education talks in more than half the villages and erected the banners so the message stays after they have left. Our patrollers have also put-up banners at key forest outposts where we know that humans pass through on their way home or in pursuit of other daily activities. Safety education will ultimately save lives and we hope if future funding can be obtained, we can roll-out the bi-lingual educational resources with forest safety infographics throughout Madhya Pradesh too. We still aim to develop an audio resource for future use which can be delivered by volunteers in the villages as part of a wider awareness and environmental protection programme. Our priority right now is to deliver the safety education messages to the remaining villages in Bandhavgarh first. What Else are we Doing to HelpThe recent increase in both human-wildlife conflict and Tiger-Tiger conflict around Bandhavgarh is a major concern, as highlighted above. As the wild tiger population continues to grow, the struggle to find sufficient territory to call home will intensify, and conflict incidents will increase in frequency, until more water and habitat can be provided to curtail it. We have spent the last month repairing solar pumps at five of our waterhole sites and preparing to provide our 20th permanent wildlife waterhole in the Dhamokhar buffer soon. On completion, we also plan to put another solar-powered wildlife waterhole in the Kithauli core area before the start of the 2024 monsoon. (https://goto.gg/34315).  We also plan to put solar-polar lighting in 10 areas of known human-tiger conflict in the coming weeks as part of a pilot scheme to reduce the risk of tigers entering the villages and killing livestock and people. We will monitor the results closely before rolling out the scheme into other high-risk areas.When conflict incidents are coupled with the increased risk of poaching activities, it means that our patrollers have to be on high alert at all times. We must, therefore, ensure that we can maintain a minimum of tripled patrolling especially throughout the next four months when we know that the poachers will be very active. https://goto.gg/28767.Making a DifferenceThanks to your continued support, we continue to cover an extra 1800 km (1135 miles) of wild tiger territory per month with our tripled patrols. During the patrolling, it is essential to ensure sufficient time to search for snares; traps and signs of poisoners around forest areas where human encroachment is widespread as poachers are more active. We also need to maintain our patrols around the periphery of villages where crop raiding and livestock killing is also rife. Our increased patrolling helps us to curb human encroachment into wild tigers’ territories and allows us to provide safety advice for those trying to protect their crops and livestock from wandering elephants and tigers respectively.With all the 60 tiger cubs born during the pandemic now young adults, we have many more wild tigers to keep safe, so your help is crucial. Yesterday. we received news of 6 more precious small cubs from two tigresses which will need our help too to add to 16 cubs we already learned about in February. Your gift, however large or small can make a huge difference as to whether Bandhavgarh’s wild tigers and cubs can survive the unprecedented threats they face:Without our help, we know that more wild tigers will die; and more humans will be mauled or killed due to encroachment or human-tiger conflict. Sadly, with every human life lost comes another threat to the wild tiger’s survival in the form of retaliation; thus we must protect both if we are to ensure that wild tigers can have a wild future.Please don’t hesitate if you can help, your donation can be the difference between life and death for a wild tiger, as it helps to increase our patrolling when it is most needed. Every tiger and every tiger cub counts. Thank you for making our fight against poachers, the changing climate and human-animal conflict possible.

Bill Gates argued in 2023 that the idea of planting enough trees to solve the climate crisis is “complete nonsense,” and the efficacy of tree planting has been a widely debated topic.While it is clear that only planting trees cannot solve the world’s climate issues, nor will any single action, arguments for moving away from it altogether are often dismissive of the true potential that culturally-appropriate and holistic tree programs can have within larger development initiatives.The value of the number of trees planted toward mitigating climate impacts must be measured in consideration with the number of women empowered, the number of farming terraces constructed, the number of water pipes installed, the number of family incomes stabilized, and all other measures involved in community development.Tree Planting Done WrongStudies against tree planting as climate action often highlight the impact of underdeveloped tree planting programs, including poor growth rates, destruction of native ecosystems, and monoculture plantations that store minimal carbon.Such negative effects do exist globally where improperly implemented projects overlook a region’s environmental and social contexts. In fact, tree planting solely for economic gain (often the case with misdirected companies or individuals at the helm), is counterproductive to climate mitigation goals. The true value of tree planting can only be determined when examining them as a whole, from a project’s conception to its wider development impacts.A Holistic View of Tree Planting Few people claim that tree planting is a cure-all solution to our environmental crisis, but opposition to tree planting as a major strategy ignores the carefully thought-out projects involving endemic species and local people that have significant, far-reaching impacts.A truly sustainable initiative must begin with a community’s own indication of their goals, leading to locally developed action plans to achieve those goals. That is to say, a tree planted is not simply a tree but an embodiment of a community’s discovery of these goals and determination to achieve them.Studies have shown the important value that tree planting projects can have so long as they have clear, locally-determined goals, coordinated efforts between all stakeholders, and a focus on entire ecosystems over single trees.People plant trees for a number of different reasons including environmental restoration, economic benefit, and cultural or spiritual values. Therefore, the number of trees planted cannot be seen as the end goal but rather a single step in a multi-faceted movement towards development.It is critical that tree planting be appreciated not only for the trees themselves, but also for their role in the empowerment journeys of communities, the construction of vital agriculture and water infrastructure, the enhancement of food and water security, and the overall fostering of long-term community resilience.A Model of Planting Trees for DevelopmentWhen tree planting is launched as a component of larger development, it often results not only in agroforestry-related outcomes, but also other indicators like higher literacy rates, increases in girls’ participation in education, water and school infrastructure, and other vital priorities that communities identify.In Morocco, a community program has been implemented for agricultural advancement, food security, and women’s empowerment that encompasses tree planting’s transformative potential.The program applies a new technique to tree planting that shifts from plastic to biodegradable sapling sacks produced by the local women’s cooperative. This project was born from the community’s women themselves who determined that developing their sewing skills would be a rewarding and profitable way to build their cooperative.Through this initiative, the women benefit from the profits of selling their products and gain a sense of purpose and accomplishment from having built their cooperative. In return, their products offer a more sustainable alternative to typical tree planting methods. These benefits return to the community and cooperative in the form of income for farmers, food products to be consumed or sold, and employment for local people.Trees in a Cycle of Sustainable DevelopmentWell-designed tree planting programs spark cycles of environmental action and empowerment where each encourages progress in the other. For example, many tree planting techniques improve soil quality, and soils are another major carbon sink. When farmers are empowered to undertake agroforestry practices that improve soil, farm ecosystems as a whole benefit and increase in carbon storage capacity.Tree planting also creates opportunities for renewable energy. Energy input is critical at all steps of agricultural production, with renewable energy offering the most sustainable approach. For example, integrating solar panels with tree planting to power irrigation means that carbon is sequestered through trees while energy-related carbon emissions are reduced.This cycle expands beyond the environment through cooperative building, for example, where alternative livelihood sources are built. Sustainable tree planting also enhances food and water security, which has outsized impacts on the health and well-being of a community. When people feel healthier, they are more able to go to school and work and contribute to their communities.Ultimately, we need this kind of cyclical rather than linear action to see long-term development and avert climate catastrophes. When systems are more resilient, local people become more resilient as well. And, when people begin to see the benefits of tree planting programs, it empowers them to take their efforts even further.While the act of tree planting alone cannot solve all of the world’s climate problems, the rhetoric that tree planting is ‘nonsense’ discourages investment into reforestation and afforestation initiatives that are increasingly critical and have proven to be successful in sparking long-term development processes.","teaser":"Recent assertions have suggested that tree planting is not as effective a climate solution as once thought Bill Gates argued in 2023 that the idea of planting enough trees to solve the climate crisis is “complete nonsense,” and the efficacy of tree planting has been a widely debated topic","charity_project":"Marine Ecosystem Restoration"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" A tree nursery in Azilal: a work of love ","body":"Both of my grandmothers were excellent gardeners. They grew tomatoes (a notoriously temperamental plant), figs, basil, mint, and a plethora of other plants meant to attract and nurture beautiful creatures such as butterflies and hummingbirds. They, perhaps more than anyone else I know, had green thumbs.In the United States, many accept as a fact of gardening life that those with the secret power of the “green thumb” are the ones whose gardens and farms will thrive. These people have a knack for supporting plants. And for those who do not have this green thumb — me — we simply lament the lack of this gardening prerequisite before giving up on plants entirely.But no matter how large a role this term “green thumb” plays in colloquial conversations, it is not a scientific phenomenon. So what, then, does it mean to have a green thumb?I do not know if Mohammed, the caretaker of the High Atlas Foundation’s tree nursery in Azilal, has ever heard the term “green thumb” or if there is even something comparable in Moroccan colloquial Arabic. But he, in wholly embracing his role as a nursery caretaker, has thought deeply about what it means to give to the land and to expect it to give something back to the community. For him, it seems, a green thumb is not an intrinsic trait but rather a love for plant-based work that can and should be cultivated.The Azilal tree nursery began in 2014 as the second tree nursery project that HAF undertook. It now houses approximately 250,000 saplings, almost half of which are olive trees. The rest include a mix of almond, pomegranate, grapes, and fig trees. These trees are supported by a well, a solar-powered water pump, a basin, and intricate networks of drip irrigation. Additionally, there are multiple, extremely humid greenhouses, containing mostly olive trees.In all the ways one would expect of a well-established tree nursery with exceptional biodiversity and deep ties to the community, the Azilal tree nursery seems to be thriving. The only problem that Mohammed identified was the pesky greenhouses — they were shaped more like squares than half-circles, a form which could pose a problem if rain fell.Located on the hillside of the High Atlas mountains, this is not an easy place to raise baby trees. The land had to be terraced before the idea of trees was even possible. Water, while not as scarce here as elsewhere in Morocco, is a precious resource. And there are no seasonal pauses in work.The fact that the greenhouses were the only problem and that everything else at this nursery — most importantly, the trees themselves — was in tip-top shape speaks to the sort of caretaker Mohammed is. According to Amina Al Hajjami, he is “perfect” because he is creative in solving the problems of his nursery, quick to learn from both mistakes and successes, and deeply intelligent. I do not say this to tell a tale of one man who triumphs over all the environmental and financial challenges in his way — that would be an enormous cliché and worse untruthful to the reality of the Azilal tree nursery. For one thing, the challenges have never entirely disappeared but are rather ever-present. But more importantly than that banal yet hard reality, is the fact that this tree nursery is, above all, a labor of love. Specifically, a community labor of love.Caretaker Mohammed has had unique success in the size of what he, with the help and support of many others, has achieved. In the United States, we would say that he has a “green thumb.” But for him, the diagnosis of whatever success he has achieved is much simpler — if you do not give to the land and to the trees from the bottom of your heart, the seeds will not grow. Plants can only ever succeed when they are the product of “hard work with love.”In his own words, he is driven not necessarily by the physical result of what his labor produces so much as the value he knows he is giving the community. For him, the immense challenge of autumn when there is such hustle and bustle is manageable when put into perspective — each tree helps a farmer become more self-sufficient and returns biodiverse nutrients to the soil.So perhaps, people who “have” green thumbs are not endowed with a special plant-related gift. Rather, they are people,like Caretaker Mohammed, who have the passion to give to the land with their full hearts and the strength to expect it to give back.","teaser":"Both of my grandmothers were excellent gardeners They grew tomatoes (a notoriously temperamental plant), figs, basil, mint, and a plethora of other plants meant to attract and nurture beautiful creatures such as butterflies and hummingbirds These people have a knack for supporting plants","charity_project":"Clean Energy Transition"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Planting trees and promoting the culture of planting among younger generations ","body":"We are thankful to our partners in 2024; Reforest aims to plant 500,000 trees with the High Atlas Foundation.On January 15th, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) celebrated National Tree Planting Day.

Their experiences highlighted our joint achievements, and the participants’ stories convey their appreciation of learning, change, and hope.Our Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP) program has made a deep impression on several communities. In June, we held a basic workshop in the Bora native community of Nuevo Perú, where participants explored the importance of empathy, self-control, and communication as tools to strengthen family and community relationships. One session helped participants identify their emotional “triggers” and how to manage them constructively. This experience allowed them to see the impact of their emotions on their relationships, sparking sincere reflections and commitments to change. Participants also jumped into active “light and livelies” that catalyzed laughter, entangled limbs, cooperative problem solving and trust. On the final day, participants contemplated how they wanted to grow in the intellectual, emotional, spiritual and physical realms and then shared their appreciation for each other and the whole process.Pedro commented, “This workshop helped me understand that being a good father to my children starts with controlling myself. I want to be an example of calm and respect in my home.” Clotilde considered her experience an awakening: “I’ve rarely participated in workshops, but this one was different. Each exercise made me reflect, and I never thought the way I react could affect my family so much. Now I know I can change and start to act differently.”In August, we conducted an advanced AVP workshop in Santa Lucía de Pro. These sessions reinforced self-control and good communication and deepened the skills needed to build a community based on respect and mutual support. Fernando shared, “It’s a pleasure to open our minds and get to know each other more. Sometimes we don’t know what others, even our neighbors, are going through, and this workshop taught us that empathy and friendship are fundamental to building a better community.” Fernando’s sentiments captured a shared feeling among attendees, who appreciated the space for reflection and learning.We have also continued our work to strengthen artisans’ abilities to negotiate and work together. In August, we conducted one organization workshop in Brillo Nuevo and another in Pucaurquillo Bora. They focused on market research, customer negotiation, cooperation, and the importance of connecting with people. Artisans learned and practiced ways to improve the sale of their products and expand their market reach.Mayra, president of a local artisan association shared how these sessions were valuable to her as a leader: “These workshops teach us in a way we can understand. The facilitators make jokes, they speak our language, and that helps us learn with ease. As president, my greatest wish is for all my members to participate so we can improve together. If we all understand how to organize and negotiate, we can take our crafts to more places and strengthen our community.” Mayra’s enthusiasm demonstrated how community leaders want to transform knowledge into a resource for everyone.For young artisans like Robertina, these workshops have been a starting point to represent their community at fairs and markets. She told us, “The first time I went to a fair, I didn’t know how to interact with buyers or sell my products. Now, with what I learned in this workshop, I feel ready to negotiate, to speak about our crafts confidently, and to make sure our work is valued.” This sense of empowerment has been key to encourage young artisans to feel supported and motivated to get involved in community activities.In September, we held an Artisan Facilitator Workshop in Pucaurquillo, designed for experienced artisans who wish to share their knowledge with others. Over four days, artisans practiced their craft-making skills and learned how to lead, organize, and guide a group. Many groups faced the challenge of crafting new birds and other animals from photos including the barn owl, downy woodpecker, mallard duck, poison arrow frog and a bumble bee. Marianela, an artisan from the Marañon River commented: “Taking on the role of facilitator within a group was a huge challenge. At first, I was afraid I wouldn’t know how to guide my colleagues, but I remembered the steps from previous workshops, and little by little, I gained confidence. In the end, with everyone’s help, we completed our group’s craft together, and I realized that I can indeed be a good leader.”These experiences benefit the participants’ and create a ripple effect in their communities. When an artisan like Marianela gains the confidence to lead, they help develop a new generation of artisans who will, in turn, amplify the knowledge they’ve acquired.These past months have been a period of immense learning and transformation for the communities along the Ampiyacu. From personal reflections in the Alternatives to Violence workshops to collaboration in the craft-making, leadership and organization workshops, each event has provided opportunities for individual growth and strengthening communities. As Nilo from Santa Lucía de Pro, expressed, “This learning is important so we don’t just live together in our communities, but we also understand and support each other with what we need. That way, we can all be better.”Links:","teaser":"Amazon Ecology has continued to support the growth of artisans from communities along the Ampiyacu River this year to develop their craft making, leadership skills and personal developmentOur Alternatives to Violence Project (AVP) program has made a deep impression on several communities”Links:","charity_project":"Protecting Endangered Species"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Bird making blooming on the Tahuayo River ","body":"We’d like to share a wonderful experience we recently had in the peasant community of Esperanza on the Tahuayo River.  Our journey began with an hour long trip from Iquitos to the town of Tamshiyacu in an express “rapido” motorboat followed by a two-hour trip in a “ponguero\" type river bus to Esperanza where we were warmly welcomed by our artisan hosts to hold a four-day long basic workshop on weaving bird ornaments with chambira palm fiber.The workshop brought together 40 artisans who were mostly women from Esperanza and the neighboring communities of Santa Cruz and El Chino.  The artisans from Esperanza had made thousands of high-quality chambira baskets for export to the US over a decade ago, but this market had disappeared. Santa Cruz also had many talented artisans, but their signature products were colorful fans which needed a lot of raw material for the low price they could earn for this simple product.  We had bought beautiful baskets and other crafts from the Chino artisans for many years and offered bird making workshops before the pandemic, but only a few of them were still trying to sell woven birds to tourists who visited their village. All of these Tahuayo River artisans were enthusiastic about learning to make high-quality bird ornaments to increase their craft-selling income.In the past six years, we have learned much better how to train artisan facilitators to lead this kind of workshop.  The facilitators for this one were experienced artisans from the village of San Francisco on the Marañón River. Pablo had led over a dozen of these training sessions in four watersheds.  His apprentice facilitator was Wilson who had also demonstrated his creativity, patience, attention to detail, and desire to share to his skills and learn from his fellow artisans. In preparation for this workshop, we commissioned Pablo and Wilson to make woven models of the osprey and the red-breasted nuthatch.  The osprey is an eagle-sized raptor well-known for its fish hunting prowess and piercing cries on top of nests built by the sea.  The nuthatch is a small songbird who seeks seeds and insects in northern forests and is a frequent visitor to bird feeders in the U.S.  The artisans were told ahead of time what shades of grey, black, and rusty orange chambira they should bring to make these two species.  The facilitators used both photos and samples of the woven birds to guide the artisans.  This was the first time any of them had made these birds and was the first time some of them had made any woven bird.  One touching moment was a comment from artisan Marilia was an accomplished weaver.  She told us with a smile, \"I enjoyed making the bird and want to keep practicing. It was the first time I had woven something like this.  I didn’t think I could do it at first, but I liked it and while it wasn’t easy, it wasn’t too difficult.  I felt very supported by the facilitators and my companions, which made it very comfortable and fun.  I learned a lot and am motivated to keep improving.\"Dora, another participant, shared a similar experience. \"Making birds was quite a surprise because it seemed very complicated, but with the help of the facilitators, I finished the goal of making two kinds of birds. One of them was even good enough to sell to Amazon Ecology.  While I can keeping making other crafts, I can also make birds to sell to tourists, and it's a technique I want to keep practicing. The workshop showed me there is always room to learn new things and improve my techniques.” We felt and shared her pride.Everything in the workshop did not go smoothly. One artisan fell unexpectedly ill, and we had to take her to a nearby medical post. Fortunately, we made sure she got the medical attention she needed. This incident reminded us we need to always be prepared to help our community with any situation that might arise, particularly in these communities that are far from the city.By the end of the workshop, the artisans had completed 80 chambira birds, and we bought 30 of them that met our high quality standards to send to the U.S. for sale to the growing number of people there who appreciate these unique handmade crafts. This was a good starting point for many artisans who feel inspired to keep expanding and improving their skills.We left Esperanza with new knowledge, skills, friendships and lasting memories. We feel grateful for the opportunities to share these moments and witness the desire and commitment of each participant to grow.  We will keep bringing these workshops to more communities because we believe in the power of art and crafts to transform lives and promote the conservation of our beautiful Amazon.Thank you very much for your support for our work on the July 10 Bonus Day and beyond.Links:","teaser":"We’d like to share a wonderful experience we recently had in the peasant community of Esperanza on the Tahuayo RiverThe workshop brought together 40 artisans who were mostly women from Esperanza and the neighboring communities of Santa Cruz and El ChinoS” We felt and shared her prideSLinks:","charity_project":"Accelerating Clean Energy Solutions"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Days for Girls in Artisan Communities on the Maranon ","body":"While the main focus of Amazon Ecology’s work is helping traditional artisans increase their income by making and selling fair-trade handicrafts, we also want to help them improve their health and well-being in other ways. Meeting Dana gave us a wonderful new opportunity to support the girls and women in our partner communities. She is a retired American school teacher who does computer-based learning and menstruation education programs with young people in the Iquitos area. Dana visited the Kukama native community of Amazonas on the Marañon River with us last March where she shared a video in Spanish about menstruation with dozens of girls and gave out 40 kits from Days for Girls (DFG). Women volunteers in this group sew high-quality cloth washable pads which girls can use during their periods as an alternative to sanitary products. A kit also contains panties, a washcloth, and soap in a colorful drawstring bag. The name of the group comes from their desire to help girls keep going to school even during their periods since lack of access to comfortable ways to deal with their normal menstrual flow often used to keep them at home.I then connected with a DFG chapter near my home in Pennsylvania, and they were happy to give me 50 kits they made which we gave last fall to other women in Amazonas who had not received one before. The artisan leader Francisca said the kits were much appreciated because they were more comfortable and cleaner than the rags they used to use, saved them time and money to buy paper sanitary products in Nauta and reduced the disposal of these items in their communities.In February, I carried one and a half duffel bags of DFG menstruation kits with me to Peru earmarked for the village of San Francisco – a neighbor of Amazonas. We were grateful that another American friend Anna was able to join us this time. She has lived in Peru for many years and used her master's degree in Public Health with a focus on sexual health to develop education and treatment programs about cervical cancer.Our program coordinator Yully presented the video about menstruation to a room packed with girls and young women in the artisan Doris’ home. Yully and Anna then showed everyone what was in the kits and how to use the reusable cloth pads and panties. While Yully gave a kit to each girl according to her size, Anna chatted with others about what they felt or learned watching the video and answered any questions they had about the items in their kit. Doris rested comfortably in her hammock feeding guaba fruit to a baby coati she rescued after its parents were killed by a dog.After all the girls had received a kit, some older women artisans arrived to get one too. They were well used to their periods, but they welcomed the chance to save precious income and reduce pollution by switching from disposable sanitary products to the reusable cloth pads. We gave out a total of 68 kits which was enough for every female in the village who wanted one. I hope we can start giving these kits to the girls and women in our partner villages in the Ampiyacu during my next trip. We sincerely thank the volunteers in Days for Girls who sew these kits.We also very much appreciate your support which makes all aspects of our work possible.Please remember that donations from $10 to $50 made to our project from April 8 to 12 in the GlobalGiving Little by Little campaign will receive a 50% matching donation as long as matching fund last.Links:","teaser":"While the main focus of Amazon Ecology’s work is helping traditional artisans increase their income by making and selling fair-trade handicrafts, we also want to help them improve their health and well-being in other ways We sincerely thank the volunteers in Days for Girls who sew these kitsLinks:","charity_project":"Protecting Pollinators"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Roots of Responsibility...... ","body":"Dear Esteemed Donor, Namaste!We’re proud to work with RSKS India, empowering marginalized communities with transparency and impact. Here’s one inspiring story of change we’re thrilled to share with you.A Story of RADHA.........!!My name is Radha (Name Changed), and I am 13 years old. I have always loved nature and felt a deep connection with the environment. From a young age, I learned about the importance of taking care of our planet, and it has become a big part of who I am. I believe that everyone has a role in protecting our Earth, and I’m always excited to find ways to help. One of my favorite days of the year is World Environment Day. It’s a day dedicated to raising awareness about environmental issues and encouraging people to take action to protect our planet. This year, something special happened at my school for World Environment Day. Rajasthan Samgrah Kalyan Sansthan (RSKS India) organized a celebration and awareness program, and I was thrilled to be a part of it. The day started with a lot of excitement. RSKS India’s team came to our school with a plan to celebrate World Environment Day in a meaningful way. They organized several activities to help us understand the importance of protecting our environment and to encourage us to take action. I couldn’t wait to get started!One of the most exciting parts of the program was the tree planting activity. I had always wanted to plant trees, and this was a wonderful opportunity to do so. The RSKS team provided us with young saplings and guided us on how to plant them properly. We went outside to a designated area where we carefully planted our trees. As I placed the little tree in the ground and covered its roots with soil, I felt a sense of hope and responsibility. I knew that with proper care, these small trees could grow into something big and beautiful. Before we started planting, the RSKS team explained why trees are so important. They told us how trees help clean the air, provide oxygen, and offer shelter and food for many animals. They also explained that trees play a crucial role in combating climate change. Learning about these benefits made me even more excited to contribute.After planting the trees, we took an oath to protect them and to continue promoting tree plantation. The ceremony was meaningful, and it felt great to make a commitment to care for the environment. We also learned how we can help in other ways, like reducing waste, conserving water, and using eco-friendly products. The day wasn’t just about planting trees. The RSKS team also organized educational sessions and games to teach us more about the environment. We learned fun facts about nature, participated in quizzes, and discussed ways to make our school and community greener. It was inspiring to see so many of my classmates getting involved and showing their support for the environment. At the end of the day, we had a small celebration with snacks, and I felt a deep sense of satisfaction. It was amazing to see how much we could achieve in just one day. The experience made me even more passionate about protecting the environment and spreading awareness.Thanking you so much for your kind cooperation and financial support. it is very without your generous donation difficult for us !!At RSKS India, we value your feedback, comments, and suggestions on our programs.

","body":"Orangutans, with their soulful eyes and gentle nature, are beloved symbols of the rainforest. But did you know, orangutans play a vital role in keeping these precious ecosystems healthy and thriving.As we celebrate International Orangutan Day, it’s important to understand just how crucial these incredible beings are to the world’s rainforestsOrangutans are the “Gardeners of the Forest”Orangutans are known as the “gardeners of the forest.” They spend most of their lives in the trees, swinging from branch to branch, and their diet consists mainly of fruit. As they move through the forest, they eat a variety of fruits and later disperse the seeds far and wide through their droppings. This natural process helps to maintain the diversity of the forest, as seeds are spread across large areas, giving rise to new plants and trees.Orangutans are “Ecosystem Engineers”Orangutans shape the rainforest in ways that benefit thousands of other species. A diverse forest is more resilient to changes and threats, such as disease, climate change, and natural disasters. With many plant species growing together, the loss of one does not lead to the collapse of the entire ecosystem. In this way, orangutans help maintain the delicate balance of life in the rainforest, supporting a web of interconnected species that rely on one another for survival.Orangutans are a “Keystone Species”The presence of orangutans is a sign of a healthy, functioning rainforest. They are a keystone species, meaning their presence has a disproportionate impact on the environment compared to other species. Healthy rainforests are crucial for the planet. They act as the Earth’s lungs, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They also regulate the global climate, support the water cycle, and provide a home to countless species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. The health of these rainforests, and by extension our planet, is closely linked to the survival of orangutans.This International Orangutan Day, we thank you for your donations which help ensure that wild orangutans remain a part of our world for generations to come.

The biggest adoption event of the year was also held during this time where 10 rescue pets found their forever homes and loving families.The generosity of donors like you has made several transformation tales possible. We are beyond grateful to Rajesh and his wonderful family for opening their hearts and home to two adorable pups—Lily and Lynn who now have a loving home where they will grow, play, and fill their new family's lives with joy.Mottu's journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Having both hind limbs amputated, Mottu shows remarkable resilience in navigating the world on his two front limbs. His heart is as big as his will to thrive, and he's waiting for his forever family to come along and whisk him away. We are deeply grateful for your support in rewriting the stories of many a rescue pet.Prem's story is also a remarkable one. Found abandoned at the edge of a field, he faced severe trauma with broken front limbs and a severely wounded paw. Thankfully, we were able to rescue him without delay. With pain management and a strict rest regimen, Prem recovered completely and rediscovered his playful spirit. We are delighted that he found his forever home too.The number of our sanctuary residents has been going up steadily.

The weeklong vaccination drive, in addition to vaccinating 865 free roaming, community, and pet dogs, also created awareness through pamphlet distribution and door-to-door campaiging. The Indian Independence Day that falls on August 15 was celebrated along with our furry residents who thoroughly enjoyed the extra attention. This quarter also saw a record number of adoption of special need pets. In September, two tri-pawds Daisy and Shanmukhi were adopted by the same family. Rescued after an accident with crushed limbs, Maya had a miraculous recovery, thanks to the generous donations that we received during the long period of her treatment and care. She was adopted by one of our regular volunteers Aswath who took a special liking to her from the time he set his eyes on her.This quarter, we conducted several outreach sessions to schools that were well received.

The much needed rain showers brought the mercury levels down, thankfully giving the respite the animals needed badly. Our work though, continued unabated against all odds. Your unwavering support has given us the backing to accomplish some of the life-saving work that we are sure you will enjoy reading about.We scheduled several community initiatives where the volunteers along with our staff members rolled up their sleeves and participated wholeheartedly for anything that needed attention. Several heartwarming adoption stories and amazing transformation tales brought a lot of cheer, especially that of Pinky and Byte, and of Thomas and Das. Pinky, at just one and a half months old had suffered a jaw fracture from an accident. Her jaw was stabilized using a tape muzzle, and after a month of dedicated trreatment, she made a complete recovery. Soon after, a wonderful family that embraced the importance of adopting homeless pets instead of buying from a breeder gave Pinky a second chance in life. We are thrilled to have been able to find a permanent home for her.Byte's story began with a desperate fight for survival. At the vulnerable age of hardly 2 months, she suffered a severe dog-bite leaving her with a grievous wound that made her survival through the night seem unlikely. But, the fighter that she is, she not only survived, but thrived under our care, transforming into a delightful bundle of cutenes and vigor. She soon found her forever home too when Anu and her grandmother walked in looking for a family pet.Thomas and Das were both mercilessly abandoned on the harsh streets. It took a while before they could forget the trauma of their past and rekindle their trust in humans. Now, hale and hearty, both of them are enjoying the warmth of camraderie of humans as well as their canine friends.The collaboration with another animal charity in May to vaccinate almost 4000 dogs against the deadly disease of rabies was truly a new feather on our cap. The success of this campaign has given valuable insights into renewing our efforts towards a rabies-free Coimbatore.For as little as 20 USD, you can help support the sterilization and immunizatiion of a rescue pet and USD 50 covers the cost of treatment and care of a permanent resident of the sanctuary for an entire month.

Among other things, as volunteers, they helped with remedial math, reading and writing at our library, and at the local school that FAMM supports. Both were determined to learn German, lessons that our volunteers from Germany through World Horizons Welwarts, offered to the children and young adults from our community. After 18 months of hard work learning German, they completed the process to be accepted into the program to do a one year volunteer work in Germany. They made it! They were accepted into the program! Adriana and Bryan will be the first of many to experience life abroad and bring back all their knowledge and experience to better the lives of the people from Don Juan. They will apply new skills and strategies learned in all of FAMM’s projects. Thanks to your donations, we at FAMM, can continue to support our children and young adults, especially at these crucial times when violence is stalking the northern part of Manabi affecting the youth of our community. Here’s what Adriana wrote, after her first month’s stay: This month has been a roller coaster of emotions and learning. Coming from a town as small as Don Juan in Ecuador, where everything is familiar and simple, to a country as structured as Germany has been a strong and challenging change. During the first few days, I felt like a scared girl, everything was new and different, from language to customs.  My perspective changed after participating in the seminar where I met a colleague who, despite his disability, faces the same responsibilities and challenges as I. His courage motivated me to overcome my own fears and face this experience with a new attitude.  Working with young children has been another surprise. At first, it was very difficult for me however, I have learned a lot by observing how children are prepared to be independent from a very young age. It's impressive to see how they dress alone, eat alone and serve their own food. This culture of individuality is something very different from what I have seen in my community, and has made me reflect on the different ways of raising and educating children.  As for daily life, cycling around the city has been an adventure. I have had curious encounters; such as being stopped by the police or receiving screams for being in the wrong side of the road. In my town, you don’t see that, there we walk freely, without traffic lights or clocks controlling every movement. Here, everything follows an order marked by lights and time, and I feel that people always live running from one side to the other.  In short, this month has been a journey of adaptation, discovery and reflection. I feel like I'm just beginning to understand everything that this experience in Germany is offering me. Maybe at the end of this year, I'll end up writing a book with all the anecdotes I'm accumulating.

Temperatures in August 2024 reached alarming levels, with some regions reporting highs above 40°C (104°F). From January to September 2024, over 109,000 fire outbreaks were recorded nationwide. In the state of São Paulo, where our Brazil projects are located, 7800 outbreaks were detected, representing a nearly 200% increase compared to the previous year. The impact of these wildfires is exacerbated by a severe drought influenced by El Niño, which has led to critically low river levels. Many residents are forced to walk long distances along dried riverbeds to access towns, which hampers their ability to sell goods and obtain supplies. Despite these challenges, our projects are still on track. In Brazil’s Pontal do Paranapanema, we’re working with IPÊ to restore the forest, bring back wildlife and support communities to make a living from restoring and protecting it. The project is completing ten years of implementation in 2024, and we’re in the process of assessing its impact. In the 2024-2025 planting season which begins in October, 14.7 ha will be planted to bring the project to its overall target of 1319 ha.At the Tietê river, WeForest and AES Brasil are working to restore the forest on the riverbanks with native species, as well as running an agroforestry programme for smallholder farmers to increase their crop yields while natural resources such as soil and water are improved. These amazing drone pictures were taken by our restoration partner Ceiba and really show our progress: they were taken just two years apart! This restoration site was planted in 2021.In the 2023/2024 planting season, 8.35 ha of riverside planting took place in Reunidas, a rural settlement; 4.25 ha was planted in the Dandara rural settlement where the agroforestry farmers live; 40 ha was planted on AES landholdings; and a 1.36 ha silvipastoral system was started in Dandara as a pilot. All these new areas are flourishing. Looking ahead, the final 0.5 hectares of the planned 14 hectares of agroforestry will be planted in November or December, coinciding with the start of the rainy season. As for the upcoming 2024/2025 planting season, plans are still being finalized, but it's estimated that 45 to 50 hectares will be planted.In MIsiones, Argentina, where our restoration with Fundación Vida Silvestre is engaging smallholder farmers to restore farmland into forest patches, all activities are proceeding according to plan. We’ve exceeded our original target to engage 49 farmers, and the new group of 31 farmers is now fully set up. Like the first cohort of 24 farmers recruited in 2022, they’ll devote around 4 ha of farmland each to agroforestry systems to grow a popular cash crop, yerba mate, and the restoration of forest patches.Two training sessions were provided, one on yerba mate management and harvesting, and the other on soil preparation (below). At the end of July yerba mate planting began, with the field team providing technical support, and in late August and early September the native trees were planted, both for agroforestry and full restoration planting. The team is paying close attention to the weather, as there is potential for frosts during these months.Thank you for helping to make all this possible!","teaser":"This year, Brazil is experiencing a severe climate situation Temperatures in August 2024 reached alarming levels, with some regions reporting highs above 40°C (104°F) From January to September 2024, over 109,000 fire outbreaks were recorded nationwideIn the 2023/2024 planting season, 8","charity_project":"Reducing Deforestation in Southeast Asia"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Welcome, Earth Allies!

The results speak for themselves! When we visited our Tietê Forests project with AES in April, students from Instituto Terra presented some great results from their monitoring of the Dandara agroforestry project. All of the farmers are happy with the project, and three-quarters of them are even applying agroforestry techniques in other parts of their farms! The survey found that before starting the project, the farmers' main motivations in joining were economic and well-being; after their agroforestry plots had been established, they also appreciated the added benefits of agroforestry systems: the importance of growing agro-ecological food in the rural settlement, and how collective activities during setup and maintenance strengthen the community.Six of the 2022 agroforestry plots have started vegetable production, with an estimated 7 tons of produce harvested, mainly lemons, eggplants, scarlet eggplants and around 17 other species of vegetable. The farmers raised more than BRL 43,000 ($7800) from vegetable sales, with Rose and Donizete’s produce alone raising an astonishing BRL 28,164! As for the Misiones project in Argentina, our partner FVS recently produced two great 20-minute videos that really give a feel for the landscape and the lives of the people living there. In “STORIES OF RESTORATION - Water and dignity”, some of the farmers in San Pedro municipality who are working with FVS and WeForest talk about how the improved water supplies provided by the project have boosted their yields of yerba mate, as well as supporting the restoration of their farmland into forest patches.

It has been a great few months on the projects.The final few weeks are underway for all our scholarship students in Guatemala. As well as studying the students get to participate in inter-school football tournaments. This teamwork and competition is another benefit of staying in school which the scholarships provide.Our scholarship students were once again involved in our reforestation programme to make the most of the rainy season. Over the past twenty years we have planted hundreds of thousands of trees to offset all of The Phoenix Projects’ carbon footprint (and much more!). Our scholarship students are leading the way by showing awareness of the need to reforest, not deforest, for a better future.The students are always involved in cultural celebrations in the school and in the community. With so many outside influences in today’s world, culture can often be forgotten so it is very important to keep these events relevant.As part of the scholarship programme the students get involved in litter clearing days around the community of San Pedro and the shore of the lake. They have undertaken several this year and this time they filled dozens of bags of rubbish which is then sent to the Municipal landfill site. Recycling is still a work in progress…In Peru twenty-eight students and three teachers were involved in this year’s Impington International College, Cambridge, United Kingdom, trip. The final terrace of the vegetable garden was cleared of rocks and levelled out. Drip-irrigation was installed and vegetable seedlings were planted, including onion, beetroot, lettuce and cabbage. The temporary large stone steps between the main school and the classroom which was built on the first Impington trip were replaced (lots of rock which was removed from the vegetable garden went into the concrete mix.)We used part of the funds raised to build an oven in the school. This will be used primarily for baking bread and for larger-scale school meals and celebrations. Fifteen students received one-on-one teaching in maths, languages, English and art. The school storeroom and library was also given a good clean and sort.A large mural was painted to celebrate the relationship with the school and Impington International College and as is tradition the trip was finished off with dance and food.In Ecuador graduations marked the end of the school year with our six local teachers playing an important role in their education, especially as we continue to try to recoup the losses of crucial teaching time due to the pandemic. There were also graduations from pre-school into the main primary school.Classes will restart with the new school year in September when we will continue with our local teachers as well as providing some school materials and helping out with the daily food programme where we can. We will continue with paying for the internet as well as covering some maintenance costs including painting which will be undertaken in September. We have already provided the materials and the members of the community got together for a minga to build a wall to protect the school.On top of our educational support we will be undertaking further work in other rural Andean communities starting with Azabí, an hour further into the Andes from where we currently work. Azabí is a forgotten tiny hamlet of about thirty families in the cloud forest which is only reachable by dirt track. We started by delivering essential food supplies for the elderly and disabled members of the community.Azabí is also where we have implemented a large-scale Plan Huerta, the first harvest of which was recently undertaken with an excellent yield from the 4 acre (1.5 hectare) piece of land. This will economically help several members of the community as well as sustainably cover the costs of Plan Moo management.We only have a few days left to confirm places for the upcoming Patagonia charity challenge in November so if you are interested please do follow the link below. Plans for 2025 charity challenges are already in the pipeline - one of which will be celebrating 20 years working in Ecuador where apart from climbing volcanoes we will spend a day doing community work. For information on the challenges and indeed our work please do contact me on dom@thephoenixprojects.orgThank you all as ever for your generous donations to the projects, without which none of the above would have been achieved and would not be possible in the future.  Have a great SeptembercheersLinks:","teaser":"I hope all is well with you It has been a great few months on the projectsThe final few weeks are underway for all our scholarship students in Guatemala As well as studying the students get to participate in inter-school football tournaments5 hectare) piece of land","charity_project":"Protecting Wildlife Habitats"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" The latest from Fly The Phoenix in Latin America ","body":"I hope all is well with you. It has been a great couple of months on the projects thanks to your generous donations.In Guatemala many of our scholarship students were involved in a team-building day climbing Tolimán Volcano. These events not only allow them to see parts of the country they otherwise wouldn’t have though it also shows them what they can achieve personally and as part of a group. When not climbing volcanos they have been busy in the classroom!As the school year finishes its first few months we continue to identify which children are at most risk of dropping out due to lack of school materials. The supplies from the government handed out at the start of the year begin to run out now, or have been lost, so it is critical to give the children the tools to continue.Each year we plant hundreds of trees in Guatemala to offset our carbon footprint from The Phoenix Projects. This includes international flights for the charity challenges and the Impington School trip to Perú as well as daily transport taken by the local teachers.Our scholarship students, their parents and other members of the community are all involved to ensure that the trees are cared for during the first stages of growth. From the young to the old, members of the community turned up to get involved. The elderly remember when the mountains were covered in trees and have seen first hand the extent of the deforestation in Guatemala. They are only too keen to reestablish the environment for future generations.Our six local teachers continue giving classes in the school in Ecuador. Four of the teachers are part of our University programme where we help them with the cost of their studies in exchange for them teaching in the school. With this hands-on experience they should be able to find employment with the State once they graduate.Mother's Day was celebrated in the school in May with lots of traditional dance, gifts and food. As is tradition the fathers do all the preparation and cooking for the mothers. This year the elderly members of the communities were invited too so they could all be involved with the activities.Plan Moo is coming along well with purchasing of cows restarted. The current herd is growing with several previous cows into their second calving. The sales of milk are shared between the local family and helping to cover teachers’ costs. The land has been prepared and the seeds have been sewn in our 2½ acre (1 hectare) Plan Huerta bean crop. Leftover dried grass from the land clearing remains to protect the young shoots from the cold and the rain. Proceeds from this plan will be shared amongst the community who help out on the land and management costs of Plan Moo Mother’s Day was also celebrated this month in Peru with folkloric dance, gifts and food. The day is a welcome respite for the mothers whose gruelling irregular work under the sun from dawn ’til dusk in the chacras (irrigated agricultural fields) is only available for a few days during each crop cycle.Since we started the projects in 2006 we have supplied the children with daily fruit. We also buy gas each month so they can receive a hot meal with the basic supplies the government provides. Add to this the vegetables that we now grow in the vegetable garden and we are making sure they receive nutritious food each day they are at school. We have seen remarkable positive results with their annual medical check-ups which the doctors confirm is due to the daily fruit and the vegetables.We have installed water filters in the school so the children have access to drinking water all the time. The water in the community, which is only available for a couple of hours in the early morning each day when we fill the storage tanks, isn’t drinkable.Each year we provide every student with their own workbooks for language comprehension and grammar (Spanish) and maths so they can follow lessons and work individually when the teacher takes another class. We only have one teacher per two grades and the academic levels of the children vary greatly as more students join the school with limited prior teaching. By having their own workbooks they can get on with set work at their own pace when the teacher is not available.We continue to welcome the next generation of children into the school. Silvia was one of our first students graduating 6th grade in 2007. Her brother Sadán, shown here, graduated in 2016 and is about to finish secondary school.For those of you in the UK we will be taking on the London Bridges Charity Challenge once again on Saturday 3rd August followed by a reunion in a pub. We plan to walk the fifteen bridges and 12 miles (20km) from Tower Bridge to Putney Bridge where we will have a Phoenix reunion in a pub there. As we tick off the bridges we will also take on the Phoenix treasure hunt to find objects and landmarks that are associated with our work in Latin America so feel free to bring the family too. Please let us know by emailing me on dom@thephoenixprojects.org if you are interested in joining us from the start, halfway or even just for the reunion in Putney.We still have extra spaces for the Patagonia Challenge in November so if you are interested please do let us know as we will need to know final numbers by September and for those of you with Instagram we recently started to update our account once again after a couple of years’ hiatus so please do seek us out on phoenix_flying_2020Have a great JuneCheersLinks:","teaser":"I hope all is well with you It has been a great couple of months on the projects thanks to your generous donationsIn Guatemala many of our scholarship students were involved in a team-building day climbing Tolimán Volcano From the young to the old, members of the community turned up to get involved","charity_project":"Supporting Sustainable Urban Development"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" 2024 off to a great start in Latin America ","body":"I hope all is well with you. It has been a great start to the year on the projects thanks to your donations to the Appeal. One hundred scholarship students started the school year in Guatemala in both secondary school and college and we handed out a further one hundred bags of necessary supplies to primary school students. Whilst the Government does supply the basics at the start of the year a more complete set is always needed which the parents cannot provide so these extra utensils give the children the best chance of a good education during 2024.As has always been the case, education tends to be the first sacrifice when there is no money. Many days over the past two months have been spent visiting families in several villages and hamlets around the lake to find those in the most need and who are willing to continue their studies. Some students have underlying health issues which have taken precedence too though with the necessary tools they can now continue their studies.The classroom materials are not just for the younger children entering education. They are also for older students who had dropped out of primary school due to lack of money to buy these materials. They now have the chance to continue their education, graduate primary school and enter secondary school with our scholarship programme.We supported two community-led scheme to clean the lake’s shore around Santiago Atitlán where our scholarship students and their parents filled seventy sacks with plastic and other rubbish. This year we want to continue to emphasise the importance of team sports in the schools and our scholarship students got stuck into a football competition. Work will soon commence on school Plan Huertas to provide additional daily meals and we plan to extend our Plan Costura (sewing business) to involve more single mothers and University students.  In Ecuador classes headed into the second half of the school year with a new printer and the house for the new family was finished with the materials for the roof purchased thanks to the Appeal. Work will begin shortly on securing a new area for a playground next to the school with a wall as well as a school vegetable garden for daily meals. A new sustainable Plan Huerta (vegetables) in a fifth community producing beans has started on a 2½ acre piece of land and aims to provide part-time income for several members of the community as well as income for the management of Plan Moo as the herd continues to grow.Celebración de la Lengua Materna – Kichwa del Pueblo Otavalo (celebration of the mother tongue – Kichwa) was held in the school. In Ecuador Pawkar Raymi and Muchuk Nina were celebrated giving thanks to Pachamama (Mother Earth) for the flowering of crops and the upcoming harvests of grains. Fanesca was also prepared by the parents for Semana Santa (Easter) which is a soup made from a variety of ingredients including beans, grains, fish, eggs and many others.The parents got together for a minga this month and the whole school was disinfected, all the windows cleaned and small paint jobs were undertaken. Preparation for the new school vegetable garden was also started with lots of earth removed and new darker earth brought in before sowing.Finally in Perú the new school year got back underway in March with more children entering grades one and two as increased numbers of families migrate from the interior of the country (the altiplano and jungle). Once we know the total number of students we will provide each one with their own text and workbook, as we do each year. We are also installing filtered water dispensers in each classroom due to the poor quality and irregular supply.     It goes without saying that you cannot study on an empty stomach though the vast majority of the families where we work cannot provide much more than the absolute basics at home, usually a few boiled or dried potatoes or noodles in hot water with some herbs. Some governments have become more proactive with school meals over the years by providing some supplies like rice and beans though these generally run out well before the next delivery.We have seen the success of the Plan Huerta that we started in Perú in 2022 with Impington International College. The government sends doctors each year to check on the children’s basic health and whilst most are underweight and anemic the levels of chronic malnutrition have reduced.Our school Plan Huertas aim to provide sufficient vegetables sustainably for the students on a daily basis with any extra used to barter for other products which cannot be grown or shared with the families to eat at home. Our larger plans, like the one we are starting in Ecuador this month, aim to provide part-time employment for members of the community throughout the year whilst generating income to cover other project costs. As you can see we've had a great start to the year and to help us continue our work over the next few months GlobalGiving will be matching all donations up to $50/£40 by 50% this week (Monday 8th - Friday 12th April) whilst available funds last as part of their Little By Little Campaign which is a fantastic opportunity for the projects. If you can donate anything this week to take advantage of the matching, thank you so much in advance. For those of you with Instagram we have started to update our account once again after a couple of years’ hiatus so please do seek us out on phoenix_flying_2020We are nearing capacity for the Patagonia Charity Challenge (please follow the link below for details and costs) which is raising money for all the projects so if you are interested in joining us in November 2024 please do let us know by emailing info@thephoenixprojects.org We will also be taking on the London Bridges Charity Challenge again on Saturday 3rd August followed by a reunion in a pub.

Our crew of rotating men, totally 18 persons, made it through the year accident free. We are always thrilled to stay safe from the snakes and sharp blades of machetes and uneven terrain where we can fall and hurt ourselves. We rarely discuss the dangers of our work since we have been lucky over the years. We go in with good intentions and everyone stays alert in the grassy fields to take care of each other while taking expert care of the trees. We have over 14,000 trees under management between 1-4 years old. We also rarely talk about the rigors of getting up at 4 am daily to get an early start on our day´s work. In fact, we are a special crew of people who relish being the early birds who rise with the dawn and get going. Plus it helps us get our work done before the afternoon rains come in too strong.Currently, we are experiencing heavy rains for days in a row and lands are saturated. It is going top be necessary to stay extra vigilant for funghus growth which can kill trees. We can apply calcium carbonate once these rains stop to give our babies some added protection.And yes, the rains continue and the grass keeps growing so we start field work on maintenance again this week chopping grasses around from from 2000 one year trees which were planted in July on two separate community projects. We will be counting any deaths and comparing the count now from what ends up dying and needing replacement by next May the beginning of  rainy season 2025. It is normal for some trees to die upwards of 10%  given the harsh hotter summers and wierd rain seasons we have been experiencing the last 7 years. We replace every tree to keep the matrix or forest competition framework balance and strong. Every single time I receiv e a note from GlobalGiving about your recurring donations, I simply cannot express the gratitude I feel and send out every single time. YOU are making a difference by giving back! In this thankful season leading up to holidays, we hope you will share us with friends and family either in the form of gifts or suggestions for your own network to join us in bringing the rainforest back to life.

Thats why we focus on intently at the beginning of the season on cleaning and replacing any dead tyrees as part of our guarantee for every tree you sponsor. Death rates have been goping up over the past 6 years and this year again, mortality loss hovers around 12%. We remain satisfied, nevertheless, with the overall growth of the projects and simply accept that climate change has made the rains more intermittent which means the grass grows more and tends to choke trees during the summer season when it used to be much more dry with barely any rain falling. Once we finished maintaining all the 8300 trees under managtement, we turned our attention to planting more trees to keep up with our sponsors. We are currently in the process of  planting 1500-2000 more trees in Refugio San Antonio as well as 400 more trees with neighbors in a new area centered around the pineapple plantations.

We also sewed over 3.2 million seeds in the 10 community nurseries supported by HAF, all with the intent of realizing the livelihood goals of farming families and enhancing agricultural diversity.Based on fruit tree varieties prioritized by farmers of Morocco, these trees primarily include olive but also almond, argan, carob, cherry, fig, grape, mulberry, pomegranate, and walnut, as well as other forestry trees and herb species.This year’s tree distribution has already benefited 2,479 farming families, providing them with resources to improve their agricultural practices in a sustainable manner.HAF emphasizes a participatory empowerment approach in all of its projects, where rural community members are actively engaged in the process of project design and shaping the agricultural paths that they see best for themselves.By empowering local communities through this participatory method, HAF aims to foster sustainable land use that reflects the specific needs and goals of each farmer.This promotes resilience and self-sufficiency of their agricultural practices far into the future, beyond HAF’s facilitation.The real impact of HAF’s tree planting is seen in the large impact it has had on farmers and their families. For example, one farmer from a village in the Souq Tolba municipality of the Larache province, after receiving olive trees from HAF, expressed his appreciation at the quality of them.He had previously purchased the same species of trees in the past, but were of lower quality.A farmer from another village, Kahf-n-Sour, had similar issues with the quality of seedlings he had received in the past.While this farmer had a passion for sustainable agriculture and caring for his land, his capacity was severely limited by the quality of crops he was able to produce.After being visited by a HAF tree monitoring officer who brought him some of HAF’s seeds, he also expressed admiration for their quality. He said, “These seedlings are completely different. I can feel their strength.”Farmers in the Taroudant province express that HAF’s tree planting initiative has turned their own challenges into successes. Traditionally, these farmers grew oranges and melons that require a lot of water.But, in collaboration with HAF, they began planting trees that are more resilient to drought by requiring less water (such as olive, carob , and fig). The results from this transition have been significant.Farmers who received the trees from HAF are now thrilled with their harvests each season. Inspired by the widespread success, many of them are planting more trees and expanding their lands while using less water to take advantage of their new opportunities.The shift has not only supported their livelihoods on a greater scale but also simultaneously promotes sustainable farming and care for land in the region.Tree planting does not only benefit the farmers who receive the trees but also all people involved in maintaining the nurseries in which they grow.Mohammed El Assri is a dedicated caretaker at the Ouaouizeghtnursery in Beni-Mellal Khenifra region, and has been a part of HAF since 2020.Married with three children, he found the opportunity to work close to home, which was a perfect fit for his family life.When Mohammed first joined the nursery, production levels were modest, but he quickly noticed the potential for growth.Over the years, significant progress has been made. Before joining HAF, there were only two argan trees in his hometown of Azilal.Inspired to make a change, he thought, \"Why not produce more?\" Now, thanks to HAF, Mohammed works on planting argan trees, benefiting farmers from all around the region. Instead of just two trees, there are now many more !Now, the nursery distributes over 100,000 trees each year, a remarkable increase that reflects the hard work and commitment of the entire team.New equipment–seven greenhouses and a solar water pump system–has been added that makes operations much smoother.This transformation has not gone unnoticed. The community has recognized the nursery's evolution, and today, the Ouaouizeght  nursery stands out as a well-known and respected source of trees to all the neighboring villages.Through his journey, Mohammed has witnessed firsthand the impact of dedicated teamwork and community support in creating a greener future.Going forward, HAF plans to expand its reach to work with more farming communities across the nation. While the over one million trees planted with farming families and 3.2 million seeds planted in community tree nurseries all in the past year signifies an incredible milestone, HAF hopes to utilize this momentum to plant even more and promote sustainable agriculture everywhere.With partners and communities, we are already committed to plant five million seeds in nurseries during the 2025 season.Vitally, HAF’s system of monitoring trees has received international certification in order to generate carbon offset credit units, creating an additional source of revenue for farming families of Morocco.This creates the opportunity for individuals and groups in and outside Morocco to participate in achieving the tree growing dreams of farming communities in all parts of the country.","teaser":"Farmers in Morocco are experiencing unprecedented challenges brought about by extreme droughts, high temperatures, and other impacts of climate changeHAF’s sustainable agriculture program is achieving widespread success from its inception, and especially within this year We also sewed over 3","charity_project":"The Sierra Club Foundation"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Beyond Carbon: How Holistic Tree Planting Fuels Sustainable Development and Community Empowerment ","body":"Recent assertions have suggested that tree planting is not as effective a climate solution as once thought. Bill Gates argued in 2023 that the idea of planting enough trees to solve the climate crisis is “complete nonsense,” and the efficacy of tree planting has been a widely debated topic.While it is clear that only planting trees cannot solve the world’s climate issues, nor will any single action, arguments for moving away from it altogether are often dismissive of the true potential that culturally-appropriate and holistic tree programs can have within larger development initiatives.The value of the number of trees planted toward mitigating climate impacts must be measured in consideration with the number of women empowered, the number of farming terraces constructed, the number of water pipes installed, the number of family incomes stabilized, and all other measures involved in community development.Tree Planting Done WrongStudies against tree planting as climate action often highlight the impact of underdeveloped tree planting programs, including poor growth rates, destruction of native ecosystems, and monoculture plantations that store minimal carbon.Such negative effects do exist globally where improperly implemented projects overlook a region’s environmental and social contexts. In fact, tree planting solely for economic gain (often the case with misdirected companies or individuals at the helm), is counterproductive to climate mitigation goals. The true value of tree planting can only be determined when examining them as a whole, from a project’s conception to its wider development impacts.A Holistic View of Tree Planting Few people claim that tree planting is a cure-all solution to our environmental crisis, but opposition to tree planting as a major strategy ignores the carefully thought-out projects involving endemic species and local people that have significant, far-reaching impacts.A truly sustainable initiative must begin with a community’s own indication of their goals, leading to locally developed action plans to achieve those goals. That is to say, a tree planted is not simply a tree but an embodiment of a community’s discovery of these goals and determination to achieve them.Studies have shown the important value that tree planting projects can have so long as they have clear, locally-determined goals, coordinated efforts between all stakeholders, and a focus on entire ecosystems over single trees.People plant trees for a number of different reasons including environmental restoration, economic benefit, and cultural or spiritual values. Therefore, the number of trees planted cannot be seen as the end goal but rather a single step in a multi-faceted movement towards development.It is critical that tree planting be appreciated not only for the trees themselves, but also for their role in the empowerment journeys of communities, the construction of vital agriculture and water infrastructure, the enhancement of food and water security, and the overall fostering of long-term community resilience.A Model of Planting Trees for DevelopmentWhen tree planting is launched as a component of larger development, it often results not only in agroforestry-related outcomes, but also other indicators like higher literacy rates, increases in girls’ participation in education, water and school infrastructure, and other vital priorities that communities identify.In Morocco, a community program has been implemented for agricultural advancement, food security, and women’s empowerment that encompasses tree planting’s transformative potential.The program applies a new technique to tree planting that shifts from plastic to biodegradable sapling sacks produced by the local women’s cooperative. This project was born from the community’s women themselves who determined that developing their sewing skills would be a rewarding and profitable way to build their cooperative.Through this initiative, the women benefit from the profits of selling their products and gain a sense of purpose and accomplishment from having built their cooperative. In return, their products offer a more sustainable alternative to typical tree planting methods. These benefits return to the community and cooperative in the form of income for farmers, food products to be consumed or sold, and employment for local people.Trees in a Cycle of Sustainable DevelopmentWell-designed tree planting programs spark cycles of environmental action and empowerment where each encourages progress in the other. For example, many tree planting techniques improve soil quality, and soils are another major carbon sink. When farmers are empowered to undertake agroforestry practices that improve soil, farm ecosystems as a whole benefit and increase in carbon storage capacity.Tree planting also creates opportunities for renewable energy. Energy input is critical at all steps of agricultural production, with renewable energy offering the most sustainable approach. For example, integrating solar panels with tree planting to power irrigation means that carbon is sequestered through trees while energy-related carbon emissions are reduced.This cycle expands beyond the environment through cooperative building, for example, where alternative livelihood sources are built. Sustainable tree planting also enhances food and water security, which has outsized impacts on the health and well-being of a community. When people feel healthier, they are more able to go to school and work and contribute to their communities.Ultimately, we need this kind of cyclical rather than linear action to see long-term development and avert climate catastrophes. When systems are more resilient, local people become more resilient as well. And, when people begin to see the benefits of tree planting programs, it empowers them to take their efforts even further.While the act of tree planting alone cannot solve all of the world’s climate problems, the rhetoric that tree planting is ‘nonsense’ discourages investment into reforestation and afforestation initiatives that are increasingly critical and have proven to be successful in sparking long-term development processes.","teaser":"Recent assertions have suggested that tree planting is not as effective a climate solution as once thought Bill Gates argued in 2023 that the idea of planting enough trees to solve the climate crisis is “complete nonsense,” and the efficacy of tree planting has been a widely debated topic","charity_project":"ClimateWorks Foundation"},{"report_type":"article","user":"post@david-dicke.de","title":" A tree nursery in Azilal: a work of love ","body":"Both of my grandmothers were excellent gardeners. They grew tomatoes (a notoriously temperamental plant), figs, basil, mint, and a plethora of other plants meant to attract and nurture beautiful creatures such as butterflies and hummingbirds. They, perhaps more than anyone else I know, had green thumbs.In the United States, many accept as a fact of gardening life that those with the secret power of the “green thumb” are the ones whose gardens and farms will thrive. These people have a knack for supporting plants. And for those who do not have this green thumb — me — we simply lament the lack of this gardening prerequisite before giving up on plants entirely.But no matter how large a role this term “green thumb” plays in colloquial conversations, it is not a scientific phenomenon. So what, then, does it mean to have a green thumb?I do not know if Mohammed, the caretaker of the High Atlas Foundation’s tree nursery in Azilal, has ever heard the term “green thumb” or if there is even something comparable in Moroccan colloquial Arabic. But he, in wholly embracing his role as a nursery caretaker, has thought deeply about what it means to give to the land and to expect it to give something back to the community. For him, it seems, a green thumb is not an intrinsic trait but rather a love for plant-based work that can and should be cultivated.The Azilal tree nursery began in 2014 as the second tree nursery project that HAF undertook. It now houses approximately 250,000 saplings, almost half of which are olive trees. The rest include a mix of almond, pomegranate, grapes, and fig trees. These trees are supported by a well, a solar-powered water pump, a basin, and intricate networks of drip irrigation. Additionally, there are multiple, extremely humid greenhouses, containing mostly olive trees.In all the ways one would expect of a well-established tree nursery with exceptional biodiversity and deep ties to the community, the Azilal tree nursery seems to be thriving. The only problem that Mohammed identified was the pesky greenhouses — they were shaped more like squares than half-circles, a form which could pose a problem if rain fell.Located on the hillside of the High Atlas mountains, this is not an easy place to raise baby trees. The land had to be terraced before the idea of trees was even possible. Water, while not as scarce here as elsewhere in Morocco, is a precious resource. And there are no seasonal pauses in work.The fact that the greenhouses were the only problem and that everything else at this nursery — most importantly, the trees themselves — was in tip-top shape speaks to the sort of caretaker Mohammed is. According to Amina Al Hajjami, he is “perfect” because he is creative in solving the problems of his nursery, quick to learn from both mistakes and successes, and deeply intelligent. I do not say this to tell a tale of one man who triumphs over all the environmental and financial challenges in his way — that would be an enormous cliché and worse untruthful to the reality of the Azilal tree nursery. For one thing, the challenges have never entirely disappeared but are rather ever-present. But more importantly than that banal yet hard reality, is the fact that this tree nursery is, above all, a labor of love. Specifically, a community labor of love.Caretaker Mohammed has had unique success in the size of what he, with the help and support of many others, has achieved. In the United States, we would say that he has a “green thumb.” But for him, the diagnosis of whatever success he has achieved is much simpler — if you do not give to the land and to the trees from the bottom of your heart, the seeds will not grow. Plants can only ever succeed when they are the product of “hard work with love.”In his own words, he is driven not necessarily by the physical result of what his labor produces so much as the value he knows he is giving the community. For him, the immense challenge of autumn when there is such hustle and bustle is manageable when put into perspective — each tree helps a farmer become more self-sufficient and returns biodiverse nutrients to the soil.So perhaps, people who “have” green thumbs are not endowed with a special plant-related gift. Rather, they are people,like Caretaker Mohammed, who have the passion to give to the land with their full hearts and the strength to expect it to give back.","teaser":"Both of my grandmothers were excellent gardeners They grew tomatoes (a notoriously temperamental plant), figs, basil, mint, and a plethora of other plants meant to attract and nurture beautiful creatures such as butterflies and hummingbirds These people have a knack for supporting plants","charity_project":"Forest Conservation in the Amazon"},{"report_type":"article","user":"post@david-dicke.de","title":" Happy Chickens As Alternative to Overfishing Reefs ","body":"Corals for Conservation launched Happy Chickens as our first GlobalGiving project based on success with helping reef-dependent communities set up no-fishing Tabu zones within locally managed marine areas, with the first such areas established in 1999 in Cuvu District and now spreading to over 300 communities all around Fiji. By setting aside so much of their fishing grounds, indigenous communities had made a big sacrifice, but in many areas overfishing was severe and the reefs were not providing enough to feed families.  Both a reduction in overfishing plus an alternative foodsource needed to be found.  Although the >50,000 chicks hatched and distributed so far from our Happy Chicken program is only a drop in the bucket, the chickens are breeding in the villages, and since we introduced the mini-hatchery program, distributing over 70 small inclbators, the chicks are becoming more available, providing a more reliable source of protein and livelihoods, with the free range village chicken projects mainly carried out by village women.  ","teaser":" By setting aside so much of their fishing grounds, indigenous communities had made a big sacrifice, but in many areas overfishing was severe and the reefs were not providing enough to feed families  Both a reduction in overfishing plus an alternative foodsource needed to be found  ","charity_project":"Friends of the Earth"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" 30 Unhappy Caged Hens Rescued for a Healthy Future!

In 2015, she became one of the fortunate beneficiaries of Reach Out Cameroon, receiving a crucial support package totaling 80,000 FRS (approximately $133.33), distributed in two phases. Her journey began when local community members recognized her struggles and referred her to Reach Out during a door-to-door identification drive.A social worker visited Blanche's home and discovered that she was living in a dilapidated carabot (abandoned house). The reality of her situation was stark; she was begging to survive, a harsh existence stemming from her vulnerability. This difficult period eventually led to an unintended pregnancy and abandonment by her child's father.After a thorough needs assessment, Blanche was identified as one of the most vulnerable individuals in her community. She was selected for a training program and granted an initial seed capital of 30,000 FRS (about $50.00). With this investment, she began frying gateaux, quickly earning a monthly profit of 10,000 FRS ($16.67). This small business venture transformed her life, allowing her to provide for herself and her child, nourishing their bodies and spirits.Just six months later, through diligent savings at the “akaho” community bank and contributions from her njangi (a local savings group), Blanche accumulated enough capital to venture into a new business—selling unripe bananas. With a total investment of 100,000 FRS (roughly $166.67), this change not only boosted her income but also enabled her to find a safer, more comfortable living environment for her daughter. She managed to pay six months' rent, a significant achievement that marked a turning point in her journey.During monthly coaching sessions with social workers, a troubling trend emerged: an increase in young girls in Tole becoming pregnant and facing abandonment. Recognizing the urgent need for intervention, Reach Out Cameroon organized training workshops on sexually transmitted diseases and family planning for the youth in the community, aiming to prevent others from facing the hardships that Blanche endured.Blanche received a second grant and reinvested it prudently into her banana business. Unfortunately, in 2016, the Anglophone crisis struck, prompting many residents to flee Tole and create a challenging market environment. As buyers became reluctant to return, Blanche pivoted her strategy, transitioning to selling at the local table market. Despite the turmoil, she refused to leave her community, where she had built her life and connections. During periods of unrest, she found refuge in the bush but always returned, determined to persevere. Against all odds, Blanche wisely preserved her savings in the bank. Today, she proudly owns a provision store, supported by an investment of 350,000 FRS (roughly $583.33), and consistently earns a monthly profit of 25,000 FRS (approximately $41.67). Most importantly, she can care for her child without the stress that once consumed her, as her daughter has successfully started school. Blanche's dreams continue to blossom; she envisions saving enough to buy a plot of land where she can build a stable home for her family. Blanche's story is one of resilience, hope, and the power of community support. It serves as a reminder that with determination and the right resources, it is possible to rise from adversity and create a brighter future.","teaser":"Blanche is a resilient 25-year-old single mother who navigates the challenges of life in Tole with unwavering determination In 2015, she became one of the fortunate beneficiaries of Reach Out Cameroon, receiving a crucial support package totaling 80,000 FRS (approximately $13300)67)67)","charity_project":"Fighting Poverty in Africa"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Charity's Journey :Rebuilding Her Business in Tole ","body":"Charity is a resident of Tole, Cameroon.

This crisis severely disrupted the operations of many beneficiaries, forcing some to suspend their businesses and others to relocate from Tole to safer areas. Many individuals had to move to new locations, which required them to enroll their children in new schools, leading to a decline in their capital as they spent their resources on securing housing for their families. With the gradual restoration of stability in Tole, many residents, including Charity, have returned, but they face significant challenges in rebuilding their livelihoods. Charity is a single mother of two and received a seed capital of 80,000 FRS (approximately $129.62).

Unfortunately, the ongoing crisis forced her to cease operations, as traveling to remote farms for supplies became too dangerous and potential buyers were reluctant to purchase in Tole, which had become a designated red zone. Currently, Charity has shown remarkable resilience and determination to restart her business activities. She has secured 50,000 FRS (approximately $81.10) in capital through a loan from a njangi group ( a small meeting house where women come to save money and another person can take it as loan or small group where people contribute money and give to one person) she established during her previous business endeavors.

","body":"Dear Esteemed Donor, Namaste!We’re proud to work with RSKS India, empowering marginalized communities with transparency and impact. Here’s one inspiring story of change we’re thrilled to share with you.A Story of KISHORE.........!!My name is Kishore (Name Changed), and I am 52 years old. I have been the teacher of our rural school for over a decade now, and during this time, I’ve seen the struggles that our students, especially the girls, face in their pursuit of education. Our school serves a small village community where most families rely on daily wage labor or small-scale farming to make a living. The challenges of poverty are ever-present, and they often manifest in the form of limited resources for education. One of the most heartbreaking aspects of my job has been watching bright, eager students come to school without the necessary materials to fully engage in their studies. I’ve seen young girls borrow pens and notebooks from their classmates or struggle to complete assignments because they simply didn’t have the tools they needed. Rajasthan Samgrah Kalyan Sansthan (RSKS India) reached out to our school with their \"Education For Every Girl\" program. When they explained the initiative to me, I was immediately struck by how much it could help our students, especially the girls who were most in need of support. The RSKS India team conducted a baseline survey to identify the students who would benefit most from the program. They selected 25 girls from our school who were facing significant challenges in accessing the educational materials they needed. These were girls who had the potential to excel in their studies but were being held back by circumstances beyond their control.The day of the program’s distribution event was one of the most uplifting days I’ve experienced as a teacher. The RSKS India team arrived with bags filled with school supplies—school bags, pens, pencils, notebooks, scales, drawing books, geometry boxes, and even color sets. It was everything our students needed to fully participate in their education. As the girls received their supplies, the joy on their faces was palpable. I could see how much this support meant to them and their families. For these students, the new school bags and materials were more than just tools; they were symbols of hope and a brighter future. I knew that these supplies would not only help them in their studies but also boost their confidence and motivation. On behalf of our entire school administration, I want to express my deepest gratitude to RSKS India. Their \"Education For Every Girl\" program has not only provided much-needed support to our students but has also brought hope and encouragement to our entire school community. Thanking you so much for your kind cooperation and financial support. it is very without your generous donation difficult for us !!At RSKS India, we value your feedback, comments, and suggestions on our programs.

","body":"Dear Esteemed Donor, Namaste!We’re proud to work with RSKS India, empowering marginalized communities with transparency and impact. Here’s one inspiring story of change we’re thrilled to share with you.A Story of GUDDI.........!!My name is Guddi (Name Chaned) and I am 14 years old. I live in a small village with my parents and my four siblings. Life in our village is simple but not easy, especially for families like mine. My parents work as daily wage laborers, toiling in the fields or doing whatever work they can find to make sure we have food to eat. But despite their hard work, it’s often difficult for them to provide everything we need, especially when it comes to our education. Being one of five children, I’ve learned to share almost everything with my brothers and sisters—clothes, shoes, even our small house. But when it came to school supplies, sharing wasn’t always possible. We needed our own books, pens, notebooks, and other materials to keep up with our studies. I remember many days when I had to borrow a pen from a classmate or use a torn notebook because we couldn’t afford new ones. It made school difficult and sometimes embarrassing. There were times when I thought about giving up on my studies. It was hard to focus on my lessons when I didn’t even have the basic materials to write with. My teachers were kind and understanding, but I knew they couldn’t always provide for us either. The thought of how hard my parents were working just to keep us in school made me determined to continue, but it was a struggle every day.Then one day, something happened that changed everything. Rajasthan Samgrah Kalyan Sansthan (RSKS India) came to our village with their \"Education For Every Girl\" program. When I first heard about it, I didn’t believe it was real. They were going to give us all the school supplies we needed for free? It sounded too good to be true. But when the day finally came, I realized that it was real, and it was exactly what we needed. The RSKS India team organized a small event at our school. They handed out school bags filled with everything a student could need—pens, pencils, notebooks, a geometry box, a scale, drawing books, and even a set of colors. When they called my name and handed me my bag, I couldn’t believe my eyes. It felt like a treasure chest. For the first time, I had everything I needed to study properly, just like the other kids in my class.But the program wasn’t just about giving us supplies. The RSKS India team also talked to us about the importance of education, especially for girls. They explained how education could change our lives, how it could give us opportunities that our parents never had. I listened carefully, and for the first time, I felt a sense of hope. I started to believe that maybe I could have a future that was different from the hard life my parents were living.With the new supplies, my attitude towards school changed. I was excited to go to class, eager to use my new notebooks and pens. My handwriting improved because I didn’t have to worry about running out of paper or ink. I could finally focus on learning, and my grades began to improve. My teachers noticed the change in me, and they encouraged me even more. My parents were also very happy. They were relieved that they didn’t have to worry about buying school supplies for all of us. Me and my parents thank RSKS India team from the bottom of our hearts. The support we received wasn’t just about the materials; it was about giving us the confidence to continue our education and the belief that our dreams mattered.Thanking you so much for your kind cooperation and financial support. it is very without your generous donation difficult for us !!At RSKS India, we value your feedback, comments, and suggestions on our programs.

We had a very special month: Not only are school holidays in Thailand – which all the Tamar children love – but we also celebrated 25 years of Tamar Center on the 4th of October. Amazing! It is hard to believe that Tamar is already 25 years old, and it was very special to see many of the former Tamar women and their families come to visit for the celebrations! We had a very nice evening celebration with many speeches, good music and even better food and on the next morning we had another special brunch for all former Tamar women and staff. This was very informal and a good opportunity to catch up with everything that has happened in the last years. It was a great time of talking, learning from each other and it was very nice to see how Tamar was able to help many women over the years. Sometimes, when we are stuck down in the work and problems it is hard to see the outcomes, but a day of celebration and the testimonies from many former women, remind us, that all the work is worth it! Thank you to all of you for being a part of our history and for making our work possible! If you would like to see the celebration, you can have a look at the Tamar Center Facebook page and on the 5th of October you will find a recording from our celebration!In the week after the big celebration, we took all the children and women from Tamar Center to Bangkok for an outing. They had all worked very hard for the celebration and with the school holidays starting a week later, it was time for some fun. We went to the Healthy and Happy Bike Lane – a 23,5 km long bike lane around the Airport from Bangkok. Very nice place, you can cycle without stopping around the airport, stop to watch the planes land and take off and enjoy the ride. Many of the older children joined us on the long ride but some of them did not manage it all – they were picked up from the Staff of the Bike Lane when they got tired and driven to the children area – a big bike themed area with a pump track, toys to play and much more. Everybody enjoyed the trip and was very tired at the end – we finished the day at a big mall in Bangkok and everyone stocked up on ice cream and other snacks. The ride back in the big Bus was very quiet, as most people were sleeping!The last weekend we spent with everyone from Tamar taking part in the “Walk for Freedom 2024” in Pattaya. This walk is every year organized by A21 and the Ministry of Social here. This year the Major of Pattaya even joined the walk and together we walked to set a sign against the exploitation of people and human trafficking in all its forms. It was nice to see our women eagerly participating, as most of them have come out of exploitation!Sadly, at Tamar Center we had some water leaks with the strong rains that came this rainy season, and we are currently repairing some cracks in the walls and also the roof to make it all waterproof again. It seems that every couple of years the strong heat here leads to the cracks, and we need to repair them. Thankfully, we have found a good company that can help us with it and the work is progressing well.Now we are slowly getting ready for the Christmas season. We have already purchased a big part of the gifts for our Christmas Outreach to 1500 women in December, our Bakery is trying out nice Christmas recipes and creating a flyer so that people can pre-order the delicious treats that they produce and our women in the cardroom are working hard on Christmas card orders. Our Outreach team is starting to work on arranging some Christmas parties for December and much more. As you can see, there is never a boring day at Tamar Center!We want to thank you for your continued support and help with the work that we are doing. You are the reason that we can continue to offer help and hope to the women here in Pattaya! Thank you!!!For the Tamar Family","teaser":"Greetings from Tamar Center!

Today, we want to share with you about the Tamar Vocational and Life Training that started at the beginning of May and will run for three months until the end of July. The women that joined the training are receiving vocational training in their chosen profession. The first week of the training we offered them try-out days in our Bakery, Restaurant, Coffee Shop, Hair Salon and in our hospitality team and sewing room. The women tried out the different jobs and after that had the weekend to decide which of the vocations they wanted to study. For most of the women the decision was easy but for some of them it was a difficult decision, and, in the end, they decided to study baking, cooking, hair dressing and barista.Since May the women have been studying hard and have learned many skills. Most of the days there is a really nice smell coming out of the bakery and all of us that work at Tamar, are getting hungry… and thankfully we can test some of it as well. The hairdressing training has first been training on “fake heads” but now the women have progressed to real people and the results are nice. Some of them have changed their hair colors and are enjoying their free new looks. The barista team is working on new recipes, testing different beans, and making plans to offer some of the new drinks in our restaurant soon. The cooking team is not only learning to cook single dishes, they also learned to cook spaghetti for a large group of about 50 people. We hope that through the pictures you will get an impression of the things that our women have learned so far and are continuing to learn.But vocational training is not everything – they also learn life skills, learn how to budget, learn about family relationships, learn about themselves, and receive group and individual counseling. We have seen some great transformation in the lives of these women over the last weeks and our goal is that they can continue to transform and will soon be ready to stand on their own feet again and provide for themselves and their kids/families through the things that they have learned.But the training is not all about learning – there is also a lot of fun: Biking outing on the weekend, puppet training and movie night to name just a few.But even if our main concentration has been on the training program since May, we still are continuing our daily free English classes to the women that are still working in the bars, are going three times per week on outreach into the bars of Pattaya and continue to help the other women that are already a bit longer in our program.Thank you for your support and help that makes our work possible!For the Tamar Family","teaser":"Greetings from Tamar Center Today, we want to share with you about the Tamar Vocational and Life Training that started at the beginning of May and will run for three months until the end of July The women that joined the training are receiving vocational training in their chosen profession","charity_project":"Promoting Sustainable Development in India"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Outreaches, Outing and much more ","body":"Hello everyone!We, from Tamar Center, would like to say a big thank you to you for your support for our work over the last months and years! We are extremely grateful for your support and help and would not have been able to do our work without you!We started the year with a day of reflection with our whole team and some goal setting for the year and then we got into two very busy months. In January and February, we had different teams visiting us, had many extra outreaches and activities for the women still working in the bars, we had a big party in a local Hotel for the women and our biggest Valentine’s Day Outreach yet. It was a very busy but also good time. The many visitors stayed in our Guesthouse, enjoyed the Tamar Restaurant and Bakery, and took many of the products that the women made home with them. In that way, everyone in Tamar was kept busy and able to practice their learned skills!It was nice during the Valentine’s Day outreach to reach out to women in areas of Pattaya that we normally do not visit. We concentrated on some of the smaller side streets and discovered many new bars that had opened. Many of the women had only been a short time in Pattaya and many were not happy with their situation. We were able to encourage them with our gift bags and invited them to our free English Classes. A number of women came after the outreach and are now attending the classes which is very nice.We also had one of our former women return to Tamar Center. She had been working in Bangkok for the last months and the job there did not pay her enough and so she asked if she could return. She is now working again in our Hair Salon and the Hair Salon has seen many new customers due to her skills and she fits well back into the team!We also just had a great outing with everyone at Tamar. Here in Thailand the man school holidays started in the middle of March and will go on until the middle of May. For this reason, we took all the children and everyone else at Tamar to a Fun Park in Bangkok for the day. We had received very discounted tickets including a lunch buffet and so were able to afford this special treat for everyone. There was much excitement and some of the women were more excited than the kids – but we all had a great day of fun!In March also two new women joined Tamar and moved in with us, we now already have six women staying with us that will join the next three-month long Tamar vocational and life training that will start on the 3rd of May, and we are hoping for a couple more till then.Thank you again for your help and support – it has been helpful in keeping us going and enabled us to offer a new life to the bargirls of Pattaya!Thank you!For the Tamar Family","teaser":" In January and February, we had different teams visiting us, had many extra outreaches and activities for the women still working in the bars, we had a big party in a local Hotel for the women and our biggest Valentine’s Day Outreach yet It was a very busy but also good time","charity_project":"Oxfam"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" A Lovely Update From Sunny Costa Rica ","body":"Dear Lovely Friends and Family of Action Change,Thank you for your continued support of the Community Development in Costa Rica project.

In early 2024 the Hero School teachers visited 4 communities that demonstrated a desperate need to improve and expand their school infrastructure.  After extensive consideration, the Hero School teachers settled on working in the small village of Aguas Calientes. Aguas Calientes is located about 10 miles from Comalapa and is part of the Comalapa municipality. The Aguas Calientes middle school teachers explained that they have students waiting to enroll but that there is not enough space.  An additional classroom would allow them to enroll another 20 local students. That settled it and Hero School committed to pooling all available resources to build the classroom. Our first call was to Ecohab.org, specialists in off-grid infrastructure, design, and implementation.  Ecohab invited 15 of their full-time crew and another 11 people signed up for the Green Building Workshop.  When combined with the Hero School builders and volunteers we were a solid crew of 35.    For one month the team worked Monday through Saturday to build this classroom. Throughout the month the Aguas Calientes middle school students jumped into the fray and provided invaluable support around the construction site while simultaneously learning the tricks of the green building trade.  And the vibe around the job site was enthusiastic. Everywhere you looked there were smiles.  Each day we could see the progress and each evening we relived the day's successes.  And yes this classroom is run with solar power! This is the only solar panel in the village!Unlike so many well-intentioned construction projects, we finished what we started in the time allotted.  On the last day the Aguas Calientes teachers and students, the Ecohab builders, the Hero School crew, representatives from the Ministry of Education and all of the international volunteers broke bread to celebrate our united victory.

Un groupe est parti en juillet et le deuxième est actuellement en vacances. Tous les enfants seront de retour au Centre au plus tard le 30 août. STAGIAIRES EDHECL’association AGAPE a signé une convention de partenariat avec l’EDHEC, qui nous a permis d’accueillir pour la première fois et pendant près de deux mois deux stagiaires.

Doughnuts, cookies, caramels and drinks (baobab juice, foléré) were offered to young people as they left their schools; these various products enabled us to raise funds for the children we look after.Links:","teaser":"PROPOSITION RAPPORT ACTIVITES GLOBAL GIVING SCHOOL RESULTSWe have been able to finalize the schooling of all our children thanks to your generosity As far as school results for the second term are concerned, contrary to our expectations, they were not at the level we had hoped forLinks:","charity_project":"Providing Education in Afghanistan"},{"report_type":"article","user":"post@david-dicke.de","title":" SEPTEMBER 1 TO DECEMBER HALF ","body":"Retour à l'école:La nouvelle année scolaire s'est très bien passée.

Living in the same community and seeing other borrowers working hard in the community allows them to come together and even address communal issues. The women in WMI’s loan hubs in central Kenya exemplified this by forming self-help groups for a host of distinct reasons and found a path to the WMI loan program in different ways.Neema Group (meaning Grace) was started by local village women in 2004 to respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Many children in the area lost their parents and the ladies acted as guardians for the orphans. They supported one another and accessed a Save the Children program that provided education and nutritional supplements for the children for five years.When that program ended the Neema Group stayed together and members started contributing regularly to a group savings pool, lending the funds to members on a rotating basis.The loans are used for small, short-term expenses and paid back each month. In 2009, Neema Group applied to become part of the WMI/Lewa microfinance initiative and with excellent internal governance and a good savings culture they were accepted into the loan program.Members have never missed a repayment deadline since joining the loan program. They manage their individual businesses but continue to co-operate in joint ventures like potato farming.They hired a shamba (farmland) as a group and are growing Irish potatoes. At harvest they will earn about $2,000. They will use the money to pay school fees and buy supplies for the orphans they still support. If there are any funds left over, they will use them for their internal table banking loans.One of the members of Neema Group is Jamarose.  She is married and has six children, aged one and a half to eighteen. She is an onion farmer. Each harvest can yield 3,000-5,000 kilos of onions which sell for 50 cents a kilo at market. She can also store them in her root cellar and wait until prices rise if she does not want to sell them directly after harvesting. She usually plants three crops a year.Jamarose also grows corn which is harvested at a different time of the year than onions. This way she generates a steady income stream. With income from the farm, Jamarose bought a cow which she uses for milk for her family. The cow is expecting and she will sell the calf and reinvest the profits in the farm. With past savings she was able to build her own house. Right now she is saving to send her oldest daughter to University.Jamarose makes us all proud! Won’t you help her and women like her? Thank you so much for your ongoing generous support. We wish you a happy Autumn.","teaser":"Dear Donors,One of the many benefits of the structure of WMI’s loan groups is the ability for the women to build community amongst themselves Living in the same community and seeing other borrowers working hard in the community allows them to come together and even address communal issues","charity_project":"Fighting Malnutrition in South Sudan"},{"report_type":"article","user":"post@david-dicke.de","title":" Meet Our Borrowers!

Borrowers have used their loans both to start new enterprises and expand existing ones. Our loans of 300,000-600,000 Uganda Shillings (about $80 to $150) may seem small to us, but to our borrowers they provide a sea change in their ability to earn money to support and educate their families. In addition to providing loans, the WMI program provides a one-week business training where borrowers learn the basics of running a business – bookkeeping and marketing. On-going peer support ensures the women stay on track repaying their loans and offers tips to business success.Please meet:Lukeya. She used her loan to start buying and selling matoke. Before her loan she was only selling tomatoes and palm oil but matoke (green bananas) is so popular that the business is now booming.

We’ve loaned over $12 million USD in some 95,000 loans. Your trust and confidence in WMI's grass-roots approach to women's economic empowerment has translated into improved living conditions for thousands of rural families in East Africa. Because the impact of WMI backed business runs so deep and wide in rural villages and because the loan program is self-sustaining once funded, the communities where we work will be forever changed as a result of your support.Your generosity and consideration in choosing to support WMI is giving African women the chance to work their way out of poverty and stay out of poverty. Every contribution, every act of kindness, every outreach gesture is gratefully received and put to good use. Thank you!With gratitude,Robyn NietertPresident","teaser":"Dear Donors,I’ve spent the past six weeks in East Africa on my annual field trip visiting loans hubs in all three countries where WMI works: Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya As I travel, I jot notes about what I see and feel to jog my memory when I report back to the WMI board upon my return","charity_project":"Promoting Sustainable Development in India"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" METAMORPHOSIS ","body":"   In the current unfolding of the geo-political scenario in the world, even contemplating the ordinariness of our days, seems like a betrayal. We are Blessed in our corner of the world subject only to the vagaries of Nature and Climate. Elsewhere both the land and people are bleeding. in this context writing about we have been doing over nearly 2 decades  seems almost irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. Though the 'dailyness' and the' ordinariness' of it is reassuring. Any good NGO, movement/ activity aimed at Communal development  needs to have a Beginning and an end. Eventually, the specialised activity or work started by them  becomes mainstream activity and the need for a 'Big Brother/Sister' entity is phased out. This is a real success for the organisation.  Where organic farming is concerned, The Earth Trust has phased itself  out 'Organically', pun intended. The State Government and Horticultural Departments have kicked in.  TOHFA- The Organic Horticultural Farmer's Association of Nilgiris is the fulcrum of this movement. It is supported by the State Government and with incentives offered by the Central Government. The Farmers have started to 'Own' their work and are involved in growing  and marketing their produce. Our work is truly done. We are resting on our laurels. We can say with a sense of quiet satisfaction that we are still the bench mark for Organic produce. We still have a lot of work ahead. Seed safety is paramount. So we are slowly transitioning to a 'Safe Seed Space'.From our Archives, From GlobalGiving field audit visit ,quote from the In-the-Field Traveler, October 2017 \"The Earth Trust is bringing back ethical, sustainable practices in the field of agriculture, one farm, one farmer, and one citizen at a time\"..We really dug ourselves in, toiled, just hung in there and now it is pay-off time. Please forgive us if we sound smug!!Our three programmes  viz The Farming, the 2 Womens' programme and the Eco-club programme for Middle school children have all been successful. The Farming programme as mentioned above has taken off. We started our Womens' programme in 2007. It covered both skill development and Health. The Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR) act of the Indian Government in 2014, made possible a lot of programmes for Women's Skill Development by very many companies. So again The Earth Trust had to re-invent it's Women's programmes as there were very many other players in the field. We are again slowly evolving to suit changing needs. Big corporates have a large presence in this area. Since we are not about 'box ticking', sometimes we run our programmes for just 6 women or 4 women. It needs  just one bright spark to get a conflagration going, just one inspired soul  to make a difference in her environment. ET students volunteered  at the district weekly market for organic farmers...celebrating freedom from chemicals in farming  and Seed Sovereignty as part of Indian Independence day week.Our Eco-club programme has taken off with a lot of computer related activities to introduce both Environmental concerns and Organic Farming activities . There is a lot of scope here for us, but as always funding is an issue.On the whole there seems to be a natural flattening of our activity curve. Only time will predict it's future shape. GlobalGiving has as always, been part of our Story.  ","teaser":"   In the current unfolding of the geo-political scenario in the world, even contemplating the ordinariness of our days, seems like a betrayal We are Blessed in our corner of the world subject only to the vagaries of Nature and Climate Elsewhere both the land and people are bleeding  ","charity_project":"Promoting Sustainable Development in India"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" Quarterly report, July -Sept 23 & Eco Club ","body":" THE EARTH TRUST (ET) REPORT JUN, JULY, AUG 2023Safe food through sustainable agricultureWhile sustainable agriculture continues to be our core focus, our methodology has had to evolve with the larger picture for the Nilgiri hills and its current requirements.Many of our fledging farmers have flown nest and spread their wings finding their own markets with our help.

We attract wives of factory workers who are home makers or unemployed. The programme timings were changed to accommodate young mothers whohad to pick up preschoolers at lunch time.ET has always been sensitive to the needs of the people while structuring its programmes. Nineteen youngmothers got the benefit of our inputs and for the first time, we trained each student to handle our health classes and were surprised at how it elevated their confidence and self-esteem. The trainees also felt greatly empowered by being able to create their childrens clothes.To drive home the message of healthy eating/ snacking, we encouraged students to bring a healthy homemade snack a day and share it with fellow students. The result was greater comraderie and conversations and understanding of healthier options for themselves and their families.Eco clubs The programme continues in Hubathalai villageGovernment  Middle school.

To combat the shelf life issue we help farmers by value adding seasonal fruits, vegetables and condiments and reached a record number of bottles of jam and other preserves and hand processed condiments like turmeric to the market. We also ‘harvested’ horn manure (BD 500) buried in September 2022 on the farm where we grow plants needed for Biodynamic inputs. This would also be shared with farmers who find making these inputs far too complicated. We continue to grow and multiply heirloom varieties of seeds such as black carrot, amaranth, celery, dill, fennel, traditional bean varieties, corn and others. Seed conservation is an important part of what we do. Summer holidays brings us volunteers / interns and this is a huge opportunity for youngsters to be sensitized to safe food and ecological conservation. In May, our marketing and dispatch team won a special award at the annual vegetable show for meritorious work amongst small organic farmers. This was part of the summer festival in the Nilgiris visited by thousands of tourists from all over India and abroad. This acknowledgement by the district Horticultural Association is a humble tribute to the ET work and mission over the years. In June, 4 young photographers who train at a nationally renowned Light and Life Academy were assigned a short film on organic farming in the Nilgiri hills. Their cinematography professors are long time patrons at the ET Coonoor farmers market. It is hoped that this film will bring huge awareness of organic farmers in the Nilgiris and the work of ET in specific. The interviews with some of our farmers and customers was truly enlightening for the young people behind the camera.

In fact, the entire process of building the ark is said to have taken 120 years. The theme of this portion of the story is that the people, the public, any witnesses or observers, and anyone willing to listen had years of warning that a calamity, in this case utter destruction, was on its way.Of course, many of us can relate to this idea in our own lives and situations when something less positive comes upon us, and we look back to how many signs appeared of what ultimately befell.How many times could we have corrected our action, and in how many ways might we have adjusted or done something differently? Considering experiences of sustainable development and the projects that create livelihood opportunities while safeguarding the environmental future, it is also certainly apparent that there is overwhelming opportunity and, rarely, if ever, a lack of community vision and ideas for lasting, positive change if people are given the assistance they need to analyze and find the specific initiatives that will enhance their futures. At the same time, the so serious difficulty in securing the funds needed to implement those ideas—whether in water infrastructure, public health, education, or small businesses—makes implementation relatively uncommon, explaining at least in significant part, rampant, constant poverty. But we know the systemization of losing humanity’s potential. We have been warned about this and live through this. Ample warning was fixed in the story of the flood.In Noah’s time, Divinity’s patience (or that of binding universal energy) seemed to have dissipated too low. Ancient commentaries about this Biblical episode explain what it was that finally brought torrential submersion upon civilization.It is described as a consequence of that time’s rule of law, as an injustice against the common person where they were legally robbed of the value they created.Might our time be characterized in such ways, with nations entrapped by other nations via debt, where mighty conglomerates pay nothing to their national public purse, where farmers of the world grow what is invaluable and retain just a fraction of the real value.Only, in our time and perhaps in Noah’s, so much of this occurs unbeknownst to the one and the many who are stripped of their value. Hebraic immemorial knowledge about Noah’s time also explains that he did not enter the ark when the light rains first began to fall and, in fact, only finally entered when the waters reached his knees. The deluge had come and the wellsprings of the deep began to open.Sages debate whether his hesitancy was due to a challenge of faith, or whether he held on to continue warning whoever could hear. However this question may be settled, some faulted Noah for not beseeching God Almighty enough on behalf of the people, his contemporaries, to save them and their world. What lesson can workers for sustainability learn who already so honestly worry about our time, who may have spent years building their mission ark, who may have done what one feels is one’s own best to espouse and try to build a pathway to prosperity’s harbor?The lesson we can apply as leaders in our circles, as ones who may be able to represent others, organizations, groups, communities, or even just our own selves, is to relentlessly implore representatives of localities, states, and nations, presidents, prime ministers, and kings and queens.Tell what it is that people need and where. Explain why it matters again and again, and do not stop ever, not once, even as the waters rise and the heat and cold burn. And, as we are beseeched, we will try and give the response we hope for when we are a beseecher. The rainbow, according to ancient thinking, seems a bit double-edged. Yes, it is a promise, a pact that we will last and we will continue forward.At the same time, we are also warned not to dwell upon looking at the rainbow, however impossible it seems to not fixate on total beauty. Why not take in as long as we can that assurance that somehow humanity will find a way to sustain itself and our environment? Considering the warning not to settle one’s eyes on the rainbow for too long beyond just the time needed to recognize its good meaning, perhaps it may be explained that fixation upon the promise may take it for granted, may come to subdue our luster by believing in a guarantee sealed by the perfect beauty of a rainbow.This makes one think, then, how certain is this actual promise if taking it for granted might ultimately mean its undoing? Where are we in our time along the 120-year spectrum? Have the light rains started? Are we calling out to any and all who may be open to the call? Have we fortified our own ark of service to others? Are we heeding Noah’s lessons so that whether flood or not, climate ruin or not, mutual assured destruction or not, regional wars or not, sudden disappointment or not, that we have done all we can and live on together we shall?","teaser":"It is worth considering, in light of humanity’s profound struggle against the world’s climate and matters of elemental justice, how the onset of the Biblical tale of Noah is relevant todayAccording to ancient Hebraic commentaries, Noah actually grew the timber he used for his ark from seeds of cedar","charity_project":"Oxfam"},{"report_type":"article","user":"post@david-dicke.de","title":" Post-Earthquake Assistance, Morocco ","body":"Repair and Rebuild Critical Agricultural Infrastructure IntroductionFollowing the devastating earthquake that hit the Moroccan provinces of Al Haouz, Taroudant, Chichaoua, Marrakech, Ouarzazate, and Azilal on 8 September 2023, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF), with local and international partners, launched a dynamic, multidimensional relief and recovery program to address the needs of affected communities. The earthquake resulted in the loss of over 2,000 lives and caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. To date, the program has facilitated the delivery of essential aid, including water, food, clothing, bedding and tents, as well as intermediate shelters, group-based psychosocial empowerment workshops, as well as the reconstruction of road, water and agricultural infrastructure. Whilst communities continue to grieve the tragic loss of life and destruction of years of work, there is a shared focus on rebuilding. Field visits and discussions with community members revealed the need to rebuild damaged infrastructure to support individual health and well-being, the reestablishment of agricultural practices, and the livelihoods of the affected communities. From overwhelming loss has come opportunities to build back better; to realize projects that for years, if not decades, have been priorities for these communities. Leveraging over two decades of experience in community-led development in rural communities across Morocco, the broader program is implementing several projects focused on rehabilitating water infrastructure and agricultural terraces. This includes the proposed construction of a water basin, 16 agricultural terraces, and supporting infrastructure, within Missour village within the Tidili municipality, of the Taroudant province.Project ObjectivesThe project is committed to improving the living conditions and rebuilding the livelihoods of earthquake-affected communities. It aims to:The project will result in the construction of a water basin (for irrigation), sixteen agricultural terraces and supporting infrastructure including a water turbine, piping and fencing. This will expand capacity for tree planting and cultivation of fruit and nut trees (including walnut, almond, cherry, plum, apricot, pear, quince, fig, and prickly pear), as well as medicinal herbs (including mint, verbena, sage, rosemary, thyme, and lavender). Cultivating these native plants on terraced landscapes will provide the community with new streams of income and help them develop strong, resilient, and sustainable agricultural practices and food systems.Project LocationMissour village is located within the Tidili municipality, in the Taroudant province. Missour is in an area of the High Atlas Mountains that is particularly susceptible to harsh weather, cold winters and hot summers. The village comprises 33 families (households) with a population of some 165 individuals. The predominant industry (and income) is agriculture. Project ActivitiesHAF staff visited the village on 20 February 2024, and met with community members to discuss the project scope. This is outlined below.Water basinThe proposed water basin has a capacity of 144 kiloliters (kL), measuring 12m (length) by 6m (width) and 2m (depth). In response to water scarcity concerns during the summer season, the community of Missour is proposing to install a water turbine located in the existing river to power the pump at the water basin. This initiative aims to provide a sustainable solution for electricity generation and water distribution to the terraces.Agricultural terracesThe location of the sixteen agricultural terraces was chosen due to the proximity of an existing water basin. The terraces are proposed below and to the left of the basin. A breakdown of the proposed terraces is provided in the table below. Furthermore, a fence will be erected to prevent animals and goats from accessing the terraces, consisting of 400 meters of fence with a height of 1.5 meters, supported by 133 poles.PipingIn addition, 1,450m of piping is proposed. Comprising 750m of piping to convey water from the valley to the new basin, 200m of piping (with a diameter of 75mm) to distribute water from the basin to the terraces, and 500m of piping for drip irrigation. Partner ContributionAs part of the broader project within Missour, it is proposed that the funding generously offered by the Austrian Embassy will be allocated to the construction of the agricultural terraces. It is anticipated that this component will cost 74,850 Moroccan Dirhams (MAD). A breakdown of anticipated costs, including labor and tool costs, is provided below. To complete the terrace component of the project, it will take approximately fifteen workers specialized in this type of construction. Each terrace is anticipated to be completed within three days. The transportation of soil and organic fertilizer to the terraces is estimated to take twelve working days.ConclusionWhen the earthquake struck on 8 September 2023, the High Atlas Mountain communities experienced unprecedented shock. As outlined above, from the overwhelming loss has come opportunities to build back better; to realize projects which improve the lives and livelihoods of impacted communities. The community of Missour aspires to leverage the proposed project to support the reestablishment and enhancement of agricultural practices, including new tree planting, providing new forms of income as well as an overall healthy and productive community. HAF aims to empower communities to take ownership of these projects, ensuring their long-term sustainability. We sincerely thank the Austrian Embassy for their interest and ongoing support of HAF´s efforts. This partnership has the potential to support and further empower the community of Missour. ","teaser":" The earthquake resulted in the loss of over 2,000 lives and caused significant damage to buildings and infrastructure Whilst communities continue to grieve the tragic loss of life and destruction of years of work, there is a shared focus on rebuilding This is outlined below ","charity_project":"Fighting Poverty in Africa"},{"report_type":"article","user":"momoelgazzar@gmail.com","title":" HAF Water Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project ","body":"April 2024  Introduction The High Atlas Foundation (HAF) responded promptly to the devastating 6.9 magnitude earthquake that struck the Moroccan provinces of Al Haouz, Chichaoua, Ouarzazate, Taroudant, and Azilal on September 8, 2023. The earthquake caused extensive damage to water infrastructure, resulting in a severe lack of clean drinking water and irrigation for the affected remote areas. With over 20 years of community and sustainable development experience and projects, HAF’s initiated a comprehensive project to rehabilitate the drinking water and irrigation systems in the affected villages. This report provides an overview of the project updates, challenges faced, impact stories, and next steps. Project Updates Following the relief and rebuilding  efforts, HAF identified significant challenges in the water infrastructure of various villages in Al Haouz province, Oukaiemden municipality, Imlil municipality, Aghbar municipality, and Ouarzazate province. After a challenging two-month journey from Marrakech due to heavy traffic and narrow roads, the foundation began the first phase of the rehabilitation project, which included the construction of water canals, rehabilation of water tanks, water pipes, and solar panels, as well as the digging of wells in 12 villages.  Objectives:  Objective 1: Provide Access to Clean Water for Drinking To address the urgent need for clean drinking water in the earthquake-affected areas, the High Atlas Foundation (HAF) focused on rehabilitating and constructing water tanks in various villages. By rehabilitating existing water tanks and constructing new ones, HAF aimed to ensure a reliable supply of clean drinking water for the communities. Additionally, HAF installed water pipes to improve access to clean drinking water in several villages, enhancing the quality and availability of water for the residents. Objective 2: Provide Access to Water Sources for Agriculture Revitalizing agriculture was a crucial aspect of HAF's project. To support agricultural activities, including agroforestry and livestock grazing, HAF prioritized the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation systems. By rehabilitating existing systems and constructing new ones, HAF aimed to provide the necessary water sources for sustainable agriculture in the affected areas. This initiative supported the community's vision of rebuilding their villages in a sustainable way, ensuring long-term agricultural productivity. Objective 3: Installation of Solar Panels To ensure a sustainable and reliable water supply for both drinking and agriculture, HAF installed solar panels in specific locations. Solar panels were strategically placed to power water pumping systems, providing a continuous and environmentally friendly source of energy. This installation of solar panels supported HAF's goal of promoting sustainable practices and reducing reliance on fossil fuels, while also ensuring reliable water access for both drinking and irrigation purposes. Activities  The project has constructed and rehabilitated 10 water tanks with a total volume of approximately 9,948.07 m³. This includes one tank in each of Timichi, Ager N’ourtane, Anmeter in Sti Fadma municipality and Widrarane, Lamkayat villages in Aghbar municipality, three tanks in Agouns village, Oukaiemden municipality, and two tanks in Tanamert village, Aghbar municipality.  Additionally, 7,580 meters of new irrigation systems were constructed, primarily in six villages, Anfli, Aguerd N’ourtane and Tamguiste, Sti Fadma municipality, Widrarane and Lamkayat villages in Aghbar municipality, and  Armed village in Imlil municipality. Furthermore, 23,500 meters of water pipes were laid across various villages, including Anfli, Timichi, Ager N’ourtane, Tamguiste, Armed, Widrarane, Lamkayat, and Tanamert. To support clean water access and irrigation. 66 solar panels were installed in Armed village, Imlil municipality, and Agloula village, Ouarzazate municipality. These efforts have significantly improved water access and agricultural productivity for communities impacted by the earthquake.Community-Driven Water Infrastructure Project The High Atlas Foundation (HAF) prioritizes community participation in its water infrastructure project, empowering earthquake-affected villages to rebuild their lives. Through extensive community meetings and active involvement in planning and implementation, HAF fosters ownership and responsibility for the project's success. Over 60 individuals from the villages were engaged in construction, receiving daily remuneration and contributing to the project's alignment with community needs. This participatory approach ensures long-term sustainability and resilience, improving water access, creating employment opportunities, and fostering a sense of community ownership. Impact  The projects has provided access to clean drinking and irrigation water system  for over 7,823  individuals across 1,830  households in the 14  affected villages. This has significantly improved the health and well-being of the communities, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases. The rehabilitation and construction of irrigation systems have revitalized agriculture in the 12 villages. This has increased agricultural productivity, providing a sustainable source of income and food security for the communities. The project has created employment opportunities for local members, contributing to the economic recovery of the affected areas. The participatory approach adopted by HAF has empowered communities to take ownership of the project and ensure its long-term sustainability. Challenges The mountainous terrain of the affected areas posed logistical challenges for the transportation of materials and equipment.The project faced financial constraints, requiring HAF to seek additional funding sources to complete the rehabilitation work. Next Steps  HAF plans to expand the project to additional villages in the affected areas, providing access to clean drinking water and irrigation for more communities. HAF will continue to work with local communities to develop sustainable water management practices, ensuring the long-term viability of the project. HAF will advocate for increased government support for water infrastructure development in remote areas.Testimonies  \"Before HAF's project, our lives were very difficult. The earthquake had destroyed our irrigation system, and without water, our crops were failing. We were struggling to feed our families and were forced to rely on expensive food aid. But now, thanks to the new irrigation canals, we can finally grow our crops again. This has not only improved our food security but has also given us a source of income. We are so grateful to the High Atlas Foundation for giving us hope for the future.\"  -Hassan, a farmer from Aguerd N’ourtane  village, March 2024 Impact Story:  Hassan's story is just one example of the transformative impact that the High Atlas Foundation's Water Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project has had on the lives of people in earthquake-affected villages. By providing access to clean drinking water, revitalizing agriculture, creating employment opportunities, and empowering communities, the project is contributing to a brighter future for all. The story highlights the importance of access to water for agricultural productivity and food security. The new irrigation canals have not only improved the livelihoods of farmers like Hassan but have also contributed to the overall economic recovery of the affected areas.","teaser":"April 2024  Introduction The High Atlas Foundation (HAF) responded promptly to the devastating 69 magnitude earthquake that struck the Moroccan provinces of Al Haouz, Chichaoua, Ouarzazate, Taroudant, and Azilal on September 8, 202307 m³ To support clean water access and irrigation","charity_project":"Emergency Aid in Syria"},{"report_type":"article","user":"pguelfi@gmail.com","title":" Baby supplies ","body":"Many who visit the free clinic not only can not afford healthcare but do not have any resources.

We received only US$470 from this project, but we used other sources to run our program. We are grateful to all our donors who made this possible.With your generous donations, we helped the most vulnerable people in Guntur district. Here are some of the things we did:We gave nutritious food kits twice to 50 orphaned HIV-infected children in Guntur. The kits had rice, lentils, oil, sugar, salt, spices, pulses, fruits, and vegetables. The children also got blankets, soaps, and toothbrushes. These items improved their health and hygiene and prevented infections.We cared for 100 elderly people by giving them daily meals and medical needs. We ran a daily meal program for 100 neglected elderly people in two locations in Guntur district. These elderly people had no family or relatives to support them. They lived in poverty and isolation. Our meal program gave them food, social interaction, and emotional support. We also checked their health, gave them medicines, and referred them to doctors.We taught the slum families and children how to prevent Covid or other diseases. We also told them to be clean and protect themselves from mosquitoes. We gave them masks, sanitizers, soap, and mosquito nets. We also did awareness campaigns and street plays on Covid prevention and vaccination with local health authorities.During this quarter, especially in December, our areas were hit by Michoung Cyclones and lost livelihood and crops. Our Disaster Preparedness Relief team acted quickly and gave ration kits to 300 cyclone-affected families in Guntur District. The kits had rice, lentils, oil, sugar, salt, spices, biscuits, blankets, and tarpaulin roof sheets. We also helped them rebuild their huts with tarpaulin sheets.We are happy to report that we did not find any severe Covid cases in our target areas, but we are still careful and alert as many people are suffering from viral fevers with Covid symptoms. Dengue and other fevers are also hurting the people, and they spread fast among the family members.We are also worried about the high number of people who had Covid before and who are dying suddenly because of lung, heart, or other damage without knowing they were sick.Therefore, we ask you to kindly donate to the project again to continue our activities for the slums, elderly people, and vulnerable children in Guntur. Your timely care, love, and compassion can make a big difference in their lives.We also ask you to kindly support our new micro project to give Bicycles to poor slum students to go to high schools  schools outside the slums.

","body":"Dear Esteemed Donor, Namaste!We’re proud to work with RSKS India, empowering marginalized communities with transparency and impact. Here’s one inspiring story of change we’re thrilled to share with you.A Story of AFSANA.........!!My name is Afsana (Name Changed), and I am 22 years old. I live with my family in a small, rural village where life has always been a struggle, especially for girls like me. Growing up in a Muslim family, I often heard that a girl’s place is at home, not out in the world working. But deep down, I always felt that I wanted more, that I could contribute to my family’s well-being in ways that went beyond the four walls of our home.In our village, earning a livelihood is a daily challenge. Opportunities are few, and those that exist are mostly reserved for men. Women are expected to manage the household and raise children, but as the eldest daughter in my family, I felt a strong desire to help ease the burden on my parents. They worked tirelessly to make ends meet, but there were times when even basic needs seemed out of reach. I knew I had to do something, but what options did I have?It was during one of those difficult times that I heard about a new initiative in our village, organized by Rajasthan Samgrah Kalyan Sansthan (RSKS India). They were offering a three-month advanced garment-making vocational course. When I first heard about it, I was intrigued but hesitant. The idea of learning a skill that could help me earn my own money was exciting, but I also worried about what people would say. Would they criticize me for stepping out of the traditional role expected of me? Despite my doubts, I decided to take a chance and enrolled in the course. From the very first day, I knew I had made the right decision. The teachers were kind and supportive, and they didn’t just teach us how to sew garments. They taught us life skills, entrepreneurship, and even involved us in sports activities. It was as if a whole new world was opening up before my eyes.I remember the first time I made a dress on my own. The pride I felt was indescribable. It wasn’t just about the dress; it was about proving to myself that I could learn, that I could create something beautiful with my own hands. The sense of accomplishment gave me a newfound confidence, and for the first time, I started to believe that I had a future outside the confines of our home.Over the three months, I learned more than just sewing techniques. I learned how to manage money, how to market products, and how to think like an entrepreneur. These were skills I had never imagined I would acquire, and they empowered me to dream bigger. By the end of the course, I felt ready to take on the world.When I completed the program, I started taking small orders from women in the village. At first, it was just mending clothes and stitching simple garments, but as word spread about my work, more orders came in. With the income I earned, I was able to contribute to my family’s finances. The look of pride on my parents’ faces when I handed them my first earnings is something I will never forget.Today, I am not just a daughter or a sister; I am also a skilled garment maker and a small business owner. My work has given me a sense of independence and self-worth that I never knew was possible. I am deeply grateful to RSKS India for bringing this opportunity to our village. Their initiative has changed my life and the lives of many other women like me. We now have the skills and confidence to create a better future for ourselves and our families.Thanking you so much for your kind cooperation and financial support. it is very without your generous donation difficult for us !!At RSKS India, we value your feedback, comments, and suggestions on our programs.
